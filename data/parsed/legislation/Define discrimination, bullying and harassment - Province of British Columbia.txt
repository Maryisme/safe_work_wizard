Bullying and harassment

Bullying and harassment is defined in HR policy 11 - Discrimination, bullying and

harassment in the workplace (PDF, 211KB). It includes any inappropriate conduct or

comment that a person knew or reasonably ought to have known would be humiliating

or intimidating. Bullying and harassment excludes reasonable actions taken by a

supervisor relating to managing the workforce. The conduct may be written, verbal,

physical, online, or electronic, a gesture or display, or any combination of these.

Bullying and harassment is usually targeted with an intention to intimidate, offend,

degrade or humiliate. Actions and tactics that harass or bully can be either obvious or

subtle as well as either physical or psychological.

Here are some examples of behaviours that may be determined to be bullying and

harassment. This is not an exhaustive list:

* Aggressive or frightening behaviour such as swearing, shouting or intimidation

by threatening violence

* Spreading false accusations about a person

* Criticism, humiliation, invasion of privacy, slanderous comments, undermining,

destructive rumours, gossip or making unreasonable demands

* Rude, belittling or sarcastic comments

* Abusive, belittling or intimidating phone calls, emails, notes, etc.

* Baiting or unreasonable teasing. For example, singing derogatory songs and

inserting the person's name or using cruel nicknames

* Nasty practical jokes

* Deliberate and unreasonable isolation or exclusion from work discussions,

communication or other work-related activities

* Ignoring the person

* Withholding necessary information or deliberately withholding workflow so that a

person cannot carry out their duties

* Removing areas of responsibility without cause

Bullying and harassment is not necessarily face to face. It may be done by written

communications, sharing visual images such as embarrassing photographs, online

communications or by phone.

Bullying and harassment may or may not be connected to a protected ground under

the Human Rights Code, depending on its nature.

harassment. Some behaviours may be inappropriate but are not serious enough to

meet the definition.

The following are not usually considered bullying and harassment:

* Making a complaint about an employee's conduct, if the complaint is made

through appropriate methods and is in good faith

* Occasional, one-off incidents which are minor in nature, like a single

inappropriate remark

* Comments that are objective and intended to provide constructive feedback

* Unskilled managers handling difficult conversations poorly

* Rigid rules consistently applied by a supervisor

* Poor communication or disagreements between employees

* Difficult work conditions or changes to the organization

Inappropriate or uncivil behaviour that does not meet the definition of bullying and

harassment may still be considered a breach of the Standards of Conduct.

If you are unsure whether particular conduct meets the definition of bullying and

harassment, you are encouraged to reach out to your supervisor, another manager

you trust or your union or professional association for advice and support.

Misuse of supervisory authority

authority. These agreements provide procedural protections for employees whose

supervisors harass or bully them on grounds which are not specifically outlined in the

Human Rights Code. For example, under the BCGEU Collective Agreement, Article 1.10
