[1] Noemi MacGarvie filed a complaint agai nst her landlord John Friedmann, also 
known as: Jan Stefan Friedmann, Jan Friedmann, Juan Friedmann, John Freeman, and 
Jon Friedman (“Mr. Friedmann”).  Mr. Friedmann’s apartment is an older building consisting of about eight units and is located  in East Vancouver.  Ms. MacGarvie alleges 
that Mr. Friedmann sexually harassed her during her tenancy and discriminated against her because of her sex contrary to s. 10 of the Human Rights Code .  This is a final 
decision regarding the complaint, and my decision regarding Ms. MacGarvie’s 
application for costs. 
[2] This was the second hearing of Ms. MacG arvie’s complaint.  The first hearing 
was held in March and April 2006.  Howeve r, the Member recused herself from the 
hearing.  A new hearing had to be scheduled a nd I was designated to hear the matter.   
[3] The hearing proceeded on July 24, 25, and 26, 2006 but had to be adjourned due 
to Mr. Friedmann’s sudden illness on July 26.  The hearing was rescheduled to continue on March 12, 13, 14, 15, and 16, 2007.  On Ma rch 12, Mr. Friedmann applied for an 
adjournment, which was denied.  Further deta ils regarding the pro cedural background to 
this complaint and the reasons for denying th e adjournment application are provided in 
MacGarvie v. Friedmann (No. 3) , 2007 BCHRT 133 and will not be repeated here.   
[4] Mr. Friedmann left the hearing room be fore the adjournment application was 
decided and did not return.  The hearing continued in his absence.  Ms. MacGarvie was not cross-examined, and Mr. Fr iedmann did not testify.   
[5] In addition to Ms. MacGarvie, seven witn esses testified on her behalf: Heather 
Thompson, Lauren Thewlis, Rebecca Brazier, Vanessa Zemluk, Asha Marie MacDonald, 
Stephen Good and Diana Thomson.  One other witness, Maria Matias , gave evidence in 
July 2006 during Ms. MacGarvie’s case, but wa s Mr. Friedmann’s witness.  Except for 
Diana Thomson, all of the witnesses were form er or current tenants of Mr. Friedmann.  
Because Mr. Friedmann did not participate in al l of the hearing, not all of these witnesses 
were cross-examined.

[6] At the end of the hearing, Ms. MacGarvie requested that closing arguments be 
done by written submissions.  Mr. Friedmann was given an opportunity to provide 
closing submissions, but did not do so. 
[7] The decision is organized as follows.  First, I set out Ms. MacGarvie’s evidence 
and the evidence of the other witnesses to the extent that is necessary and appropriate for 
me to do so.  Next, I decide whether the a lleged instances of inappropriate behaviour, 
either individually or cumulatively, constitute sexual harassment or discrimination in tenancy.  I then discuss remedy, and concl ude with my decision on Ms. MacGarvie’s 
application for costs. 
II EVIDENCE 
Ms. MacGarvie  
[8] Ms. MacGarvie testified to the best of her recollection, and I have no concerns 
about her credibility.  Ms. MacGarvie was not cross-examined, and Mr. Friedmann did 
not testify.  Ms. MacGarvie’s evidence is therefore uncontroverted, and I accept it in its entirety. 
1. Background 
[9] Ms. MacGarvie was born in Sackville, New Brunswick and, at the time of the 
hearing, was 28 years old. Ms. MacGarvie grew  up in Mexico and moved back to Canada 
at age 15.   Prior to settling in Vancouver,  she travelled and worked across Canada, 
travelled in Europe and lived in Spain for a bout two years.  At the time of the hearing, 
she had been living in Vancouver for four years and was a full-time student at UBC.   
[10] In January 2004, Ms. MacGarvie was looki ng for an apartment convenient to 
travel both to Capilano College  and UBC. She saw an advertisement in the newspaper in 
early January 2004.  She met with Mr. Frie dmann and viewed the apartment.  She 
explained to him that she was a student and that she was looking for an apartment where 
the rent did not increase every year.  Mr. Fr iedmann told her that he had only increased 
2 
2009 BCHRT 47 (CanLII)
the rent once when he had replaced the floor s.  Ms. MacGarvie was also concerned about 
the cost of hydro, and Mr. Friedmann assured her it was never greater than $20 a month.   
[11] Ms. MacGarvie concluded that the apartment was suitable, Mr. Friedmann agreed 
to rent it to her for $625 a month on a on e-year lease, and Ms. MacGarvie signed a 
tenancy agreement.  She moved in on February 1, 2004 and moved out, for reasons 
discussed below, on January 31, 2005 
2. Inappropriate comments and gifts 
  
[12] Ms. MacGarvie described several incidents that occurred while she lived in the 
apartment that she alleged constitute sexual harassment.   
[13] About three months after she moved i n, Ms. MacGarvie looked out her living 
room window and saw Mr. Frie dmann pruning a bush with no shirt on.  She testified that 
it seemed like every time that she looked ove r, Mr. Friedmann was looking at her.  When 
she looked up, he would look away and tense his entire body.  She felt that there was 
nowhere in the apartment that Mr. Friedmann could not see her while he was pruning the bush, so she left.  Ms. MacGarvie provided a photograph of the exterior of her living 
room window, which shows that the bush was very close to her window. 
[14] In June 2004, Mr. Friedmann came to coll ect the rent.  He smiled in what Ms. 
MacGarvie said was an uncomfortable way and asked three times “Is your boyfriend in?” while clearly pointing to Ms.  MacGarvie’s bedroom.  Ms. MacGarvie did not have a 
boyfriend at the time.  She was very upset and said “John, stop it.”  Mr. Friedmann 
laughed and then said it to her one more time. 
[15] Ms. MacGarvie testified that she felt that  every time he came to her apartment, 
Mr. Friedmann would find an opportunity to make a comment that made her 
uncomfortable.  There was always a reference to her sex life or he r appearance; he was 
not respectful and he made her feel uncomfo rtable.  Ms. MacGarvie also felt that Mr. 
Friedmann would deliberately come at times wh en he could catch her in her pyjamas.  
She was uncomfortable when Mr. Friedmann would look at her body and smile, or look 
at the bedroom and ask if her boyfriend was i n.  Once, when he collected the rent, he 
looked at her lower body and said “Are you not  eating, you’ve lost too much weight”.  
3 
2009 BCHRT 47 (CanLII)
Ms. MacGarvie said “Yeah, that’s what pe ople tell me.”  Mr. Friedmann smiled and 
made what Ms. MacGarvie described as a “hands out”, “fulsomeness” gesture. 
[16] In the early summer of 2004, Mr. Friedma nn was talking to Diane Thompson and 
one of her friends.  Ms. MacGarvie told Mr. Friedmann that she had left messages 
regarding problems with her st ove.  Mr. Friedmann said “Y es, I will come now.”  Ms. 
MacGarvie briefly talked to Ms. Thompson.  Mr. Friedmann said “Oh, look at these 
beautiful women, my tenants.  I am looking for a wife, because no one wants to marry 
me.”  Ms. MacGarvie described Ms. Th ompson as looking uncomfortable. Ms. 
MacGarvie didn’t say anything.   
[17] Later, Mr. Friedmann came to her apartm ent to fix her stove .  Ms. MacGarvie 
asked Mr. Friedmann if he liked soccer.  He said he was going to a game that night and 
asked if Ms. MacGarvie wanted to come.  Ms.  MacGarvie said “no”.  Mr. Friedmann said 
“sexy, 40’s, hardworking mens”.  Ms. MacGarvie did not understand what he was referring to but she hoped he was referrin g to the other team members. She was 
uncomfortable that he would use the word sexy, and believed that Mr. Friedmann was 
referring to himself.  She testified that ba sed on materials Mr. Friedmann later filed in 
response to her human rights complaint, she was confirmed in this view.  When Ms. MacGarvie declined his offer, Mr. Friedmann got very stern and left the apartment 
without saying goodbye.   
[18] Ms. MacGarvie also described an occasi on when Mr. Friedmann, while fixing her 
stove, stayed quite a while and fixed severa l things that Ms. MacGarvie had not asked 
him to.  Mr. Friedmann then left and came back and put a mirrored cabinet next to the 
bathroom door.  Mr. Friedmann decided to install it in the bathroom.  Mr. Friedmann said that Ms. MacGarvie needed the extra mirrors because “ you are a beautiful woman, you 
need lots of mirrors.”  He also installed a peephole in her front door.  He stayed a long 
time and talked a lot about his own personal life.   At that time, Ms. MacGarvie testified that she didn’t feel comfortable in his pr esence, but she was not yet scared of him. 
[19] Ms. MacGarvie also testifie d that Mr. Friedmann brought her gifts.  One day he 
knocked on her door and had a hug e bouquet of flowers.  He said “This is for you from 
my garden.”  Ms. MacGarvie was uncomfortable; she felt that giving someone flowers 
4 
2009 BCHRT 47 (CanLII)
was an intimate gesture.  She didn’t feel that  she knew him well enough to feel either safe 
or comfortable in accepting the gift, not knowi ng his intentions.  She testified that Mr. 
Friedmann knew she was uncomfortable because he left right away.   
[20] Mr. Friedmann later also gave her some stained glass, saying “Here, so you can 
remember the sad boyfriends you left in Mexi co.”  Ms. MacGarvie did not ask for the 
gift, and she felt uncomfortable with Mr. Friedm ann giving it to her.  She accepted it, but 
said she would leave it when she moved out.   
[21] Ms. MacGarvie also testified regarding an occasion when Mr. Friedmann knocked 
on her door and offered her a mirro r.  Ms. MacGarvie asked if he was sure he wanted to 
give it away.  Mr. Friedmann walked around  her and straight into the bedroom and 
propped the mirror in front of a hole in the wall.  He said  the mirror was “so you can see 
yourself” and then he looked over at Ms. MacGarvie’s bed.  Ms. MacGarvie was nervous 
that Mr. Friedmann would have to stay awhile to find the st uds to mount the mirror, so 
she said she preferred it on top of her dresse r, where it remained.  She found it upsetting 
because Mr. Friedmann invited himself into her apartment.   
[22] Ms. MacGarvie provided a photograph show ing that, when she moved out, she 
left all the things that Mr. Friedmann had given her, including the mirror and the stained 
glass, in one corner. 
3. The Bicycle Incident and Ms. MacGarvie’s Friend 
[23] In July 2004, Ms. MacGarvie had a male friend named John coming to visit from 
Australia.  Ms. MacGarvie told Mr. Friedma nn that she was going to be having a friend 
to visit and asked him if it was alright if he r friend stayed with her for a while.   She did 
not mention her friend’s gender.   She testified that Mr. Friedmann said “O.K.” and did 
not otherwise imply it was a problem.   
[24] Ms. MacGarvie testified that  she was concerned about John’s visit, because she 
had been told that Mr. Friedmann would start to pick on tenants onc e he saw that they 
had male visitors.    
[25] The next time Ms. MacGarvie saw Mr. Friedmann, she asked him if he was 
interested in selling a bike, as she had seen that he had several bikes in the basement.  
5 
2009 BCHRT 47 (CanLII)
Later, Mr. Friedmann came to her door and said she could look at the bikes.  Ms. 
MacGarvie went to the basement with him.  As they were going to the basement, Mr. 
Friedmann asked if her friend was a boyfriend and Ms. MacGarvie said “no”.  Then Mr. 
Friedmann asked if he was “an  old boyfriend” and Ms. MacGar vie said “just a friend”.  
She testified that she thought that Mr. Frie dmann might have asked her if she would like 
him (her visitor) to be a boyfriend and Ms. M acGarvie again said “just an old friend”.   
[26] When they arrived in the basement, Ms. MacGarvie sat on the bike, and Mr. 
Friedmann walked straight towards Ms. MacG arvie with a determined expression.  He 
put one hand on the handle bar and one on her buttocks.  Ms. MacGarvie testified that it 
wasn’t an accident, but a very  firm feel.  Ms. MacGarvie got off the bike feeling quite 
flustered.  She remembered that, as she left, she said she should ask her friend if he liked the bike and would leave a message  on Mr. Friedmann’s machine.   
[27] Ms. MacGarvie testified that she felt hu miliated and embarrassed by this incident.  
She didn’t talk to Mr. Friedmann about it, but  she did leave a message saying she was not 
interested in taking the bike .  Ms. MacGarvie noted that Mr. Friedmann did not deny he 
grabbed her in his response to  her human rights complaint. 
[28] Ms. MacGarvie testified that, after the bike incident, she called the police.  The 
police told her that if someone acts inappropriately, then she was to tell them that she 
didn’t want to be treated th at way.  Ms. MacGarvie told the police that she couldn’t do 
that, as it would be like throwing gas on a fire.  The police explained about the Human 
Rights Coalition and the Residential Tenanc y office.  Ms. MacGarvie asked how she 
could protect herself and they advised her not to accept any more gifts.   
[29] Ms. MacGarvie’s friend arrived on July 31, 2004 and stayed for two weeks.  He 
then went away for a period of time and re turned in early October 2004.  Ms. MacGarvie 
explained that, although she only had a one-bed room apartment, she had bought a hide-abed.  Therefore, the apartment was large e nough for two people.  Ms. MacGarvie was not 
home much, as she was working and doing vol unteer work.  Her friend was working on a 
project and needed a quiet place. 
[30] Ms. MacGarvie testified that one day when she came home, her friend said that he 
had run into Mr. Friedmann in  the hall and introduced hims elf, but Mr. Friedmann would 
6 
2009 BCHRT 47 (CanLII)
not shake his hand.  He said to him “My name  is John too”, but Mr. Friedmann appeared 
to be sulky.   
[31] Then, Mr. Friedmann delivered a warning letter to Ms. MacGarvie under her door.  
This letter, dated November 4, 2004, said:   
This is first and last warning letter to you as you are in the breach of the 
Tenancy Agreement.  You have no permission from the Landlord to 
accommodate another person.  This man must leave apartment #1 – 1629 
E. 10th Avenue immediately.  If this happen again or if you cost any 
additional problem you will gett 30 da ys Termination Notice and you must 
vacate my premises.  (reproduced as written) 
[32] Ms. MacGarvie was upset when she receive d the letter.   Fo r the 10 months she 
lived in the apartment, she was never late  with her rent, and always polite to Mr. 
Friedmann.  There were no complaints about he r from other tenants.  Ms. MacGarvie felt 
she should not have received such a harsh wa rning without Mr. Frie dmann talking to her 
first.   
[33] She called Mr. Friedmann to talk about the letter; he didn ’t answer, and Ms. 
MacGarvie thinks she left a message. Sin ce Ms. MacGarvie couldn’t reach him and was 
quite upset, she tried to find another tenant to  talk to.  She spoke to Ms. Matias, who was 
Mr. Friedmann’s witness at the hearing.  Ms. MacGarvie showed her the letter and asked 
her what she thought.  Ms. Ma tias said she went to cour t to be a witness for Mr. 
Friedmann in a proceeding where it was al leged that Mr. Friedmann had hit a woman 
with a baseball bat.  Ms. MacGar vie testified that this “freaked ” her out.  Ms. Matias also 
told her that Mr. Friedmann didn’t like it wh en too many people used hot water, and 
suggested that she call him and offer so mething extra for the hot water.   
[34] Eventually, Ms. MacGarvie ta lked to Mr. Friedmann on the phone.  She said she 
had received the letter and needed to talk.  Mr. Friedmann said there was “nothing to 
discuss.  This man must leave now.”  Ms. MacGarvie explained to  Mr. Friedmann what 
her friend does for a living (a film editor).  Mr. Friedmann made fun of that, saying “We 
don’t need movie stars here.”  Mr. Friedmann said “This is a bad man” and he started to 
discuss Ms. MacGarvie’s sex li fe, saying “I don’t care w ho you sleep with, if you’re a 
lesbian, this man is a bad man and he has to  leave.”  Ms. MacGarvi e then said “John, I 
7 
2009 BCHRT 47 (CanLII)
can’t live here any longer”.  Ms. MacGarvie testif ied that she implie d to Mr. Friedmann 
that the way he was treating her was inappropriate and that she would be giving notice 
very soon.   
[35] There was also a discussion about how to  finish painting th e bedroom, which Ms. 
MacGarvie had started to do herself.  Ms. MacG arvie said she needed more paint and that 
she had used one can of her own white paint.  Ms. MacGarvie said “How about if I leave 
the bedroom white?”  Mr. Friedmann said “If your friend was such a good man, why 
didn’t he help you paint?”  Sh e testified that this comment  really upset her. Ms.  
MacGarvie then said she did not want her friend to paint her walls.  In her view, Mr. Friedmann appeared to want to convince Ms.  MacGarvie that her friend was a bad man. 
[36] Ms. MacGarvie felt that Mr. Friedmann s eemed to be interpreting his relationship 
with her wrongly and inappropriately – more  like a jealous boyfriend than a landlord – 
and he wouldn’t discuss the possibility of he r friend staying any longer.  Mr. Friedmann 
also said “If you move out, it’s a free worl d – do whatever you want”, like a jealous 
boyfriend.  Mr. Friedmann also said “If you move out, I will paint your apartment”.  Ms. 
MacGarvie took this as an implication that  he was a better person than her friend. 
[37] Ms. MacGarvie’s friend left her apartm ent on November 4, 2004 (the day of Mr. 
Friedmann’s warning) and thereafter Ms. MacGar vie was afraid to even have him over to 
visit.  Ms. MacGarvie testifie d that if Mr. Friedmann decide d he doesn’t like a tenant, 
then he would yell at them frequently.  For example, there was a male tenant from Bosnia 
in Apartment 2 across the hall and Mr. Frie dmann would bang on the door loudly and say 
“you stupid idiot”.  Ms. MacGarvie did not  want to find herself in the same 
circumstances. 
[38] After that time, Ms. MacGarvie testified th at she received one or two suspicious 
phone calls; she could hear a T.V. in a foreign language in the background.  She also got a call from someone asking for John. She said “John who?”  Then the caller got nervous 
and said he was looking for a Vietnamese  guy.  It seemed that the question was 
unexpected.  She felt that someone put the caller up to calling her.  Ms. MacGarvie 
explained that after her friend  moved out, she felt that she was being checked up on.  Ms. 
8 
2009 BCHRT 47 (CanLII)
MacGarvie said that no one ever  called her on her phone and she felt that she didn’t know 
enough people in Vancouver to be getting crank calls. 
[39] When Ms. MacGarvie saw Mr. Friedmann next, he was nice in an exaggerated 
way.  Once when Ms. MacGarvie came home, Mr. Friedmann opened the main front door 
and said “Welcome home.”  He also offered to fix things and Ms. MacGarvie told him he 
could do it when she moved out.  Just before  she gave her notice, he came to give her 
bread.  Ms. MacGarvie refused it politely and he stormed off.  Mr. Friedmann had also 
given Ms. MacGarvie bread s hortly after she moved in. 
4. Giving Notice 
[40] Ms. MacGarvie next saw Mr. Friedma nn on Boxing Day.  He was carrying boxes 
of chocolates and offered her one.  Ms. MacG arvie initially refused, but felt bad, so she 
accepted them.  She explained that he had several boxes and she felt it wasn’t too 
personal.   
[41] She told him, “I will be giving you one month’s notice.”  Mr. Friedmann said it 
had to be written notice.  Ms. MacGarvie ha d talked to the Residential Tenancy office 
who told her to make sure she gave a forwar ding address as soon as  possible.  So, Ms. 
MacGarvie said “O.K. and I’ll give you my fo rwarding address for now.”  Mr. Friedmann 
said “Later.”  It was agreed that Mr. Friedm ann would come the next day to pick up her 
notice and forwarding address.   
[42] Mr. Friedmann did not come the next day and did not call.  Ms. MacGarvie was 
concerned about losing her damage deposit.  She felt that Mr. Friedmann had mistreated 
other tenants and ripped them off.  Ms.  MacGarvie contacted the police and the 
Residential Tenancy office fo r more advice.  The police advised Ms. MacGarvie to 
deliver her notice to Mr. Friedmann’ s address listed in the phone book.   
[43] On December 29, 2004, Ms. MacGarvie went to an address she had found in the 
phone book for Mr. Friedmann and knocked on the door.  The house looked empty and 
she was not sure if Mr. Friedmann lived there.  A neighbour commented “Oh, you’re 
looking for John”, so Ms. MacGarvie knew it was his house.  The neighbour also told 
9 
2009 BCHRT 47 (CanLII)
Ms. MacGarvie about two women tenants who had lived there and an  incident involving 
a baseball bat.    
[44] Ms. MacGarvie called Mr. Friedmann seve ral times after Boxing day, but could 
not reach him.  She introduced her January phon e bill into evidence, which indicated that 
she called Mr. Friedmann nine times between December 27 and December 31.   
[45] Ms. MacGarvie said she believed she next saw Mr. Friedmann on January 5 or 6, 
2005.  She explained that when she had come home from work on Ja nuary 2, there was a 
Notice of Eviction, dated January 2, 2005, taped to  her door.  It stated  that it was being 
delivered for failure to pay rent on January 1, and provided a number of days to pay the 
rent or advised her to move out in 12 days . Ms. MacGarvie explained that she was home 
all day January 1 and Mr. Friedmann had not co me to collect her rent.  Normally, every 
month Mr. Friedmann came to pick up the re nt, although he did not always come on the 
first day of the month.     
[46] Ms. MacGarvie noted that the eviction no tice referred to Mr. Friedmann’s address 
as apartment 12.  This was the first time sh e had an indication of where his apartment 
was.  She believed that #12 was an apartment with a big padlock in the basement of her 
building.  
[47] Ms. MacGarvie testified that she then got  really scared.  She thought that Mr. 
Friedmann could come the next day or the day after.  She misse d some classes waiting 
for him and going to the Residential Tenancy o ffice. She testified that she had seen Mr. 
Friedmann do “mean things” to other tenant s, for example, change locks and keep 
deposits.  If Mr. Friedmann changed the locks,  there would be a long process to get back 
her belongings, so Ms. MacGar vie was terrified to leave her apartment.  Ms. MacGarvie 
always had a chair against the door to her ap artment; she did not know if he would break 
in.   
[48] On January 5 or 6, Ms. MacGarvie deci ded to call a moving company.  She was 
all ready to go and ha d called friends to help her move .  Then Mr. Friedmann knocked on 
her door.  Ms. MacGarvie asked where he ha d been, and why he hadn’t come.  She did 
not recall an explanation.  She told Mr. Frie dmann that she had called a truck.  She asked 
if he wanted her to pay the rent for January or move out.  Mr. Friedmann seemed 
10 
2009 BCHRT 47 (CanLII)
surprised and said “You have to pay the rent.”  Ms. MacG arvie said she would pay the 
rent if Mr. Friedmann would sign a paper she had prepared. Ms. MacG arvie testified that 
she went over the document with Mr. Friedmann and explained it.  This paper said: 
Notice to Landlord. 
I Noemi MacGarvie gave landlord John Freidmann verbal notice on 
December 26, 2004 that I will be vacating apartment #1 – 1629 E. 10th 
Ave. on January 31, 2005 by midnight.   
John Freidman agreed to pick up my notice in writing the next morning – 
December 27, 2004 – but did not come. 
John Freidmann is aware of and will not deduct the following from Noemi 
MacGarvie’s $300 deposit: 1) one knob on stove needs repair.  2) 
Bedroom painting is incomplete.” 
[49] Mr. Friedmann said, “I don’t need to sign anything.” Ms. MacG arvie said “So you 
don’t agree with this?”  Then Mr. Friedma nn grabbed it back and signed it.  Ms. 
MacGarvie gave Mr. Friedmann a check for th e January rent and he left.  After Ms. 
MacGarvie cancelled the moving truck, Mr. Friedmann knocked on the door and said he 
wanted to cash the cheque right away and th e cheque was made out on a bank in Ontario.  
Ms. MacGarvie assured Mr. Friedmann it was drawn on the same bank as in the past. Mr. 
Friedmann stood staring at Ms. MacGarvie.  He  got very angry and said “You’re stupid 
for going to the Tenancy Board – why did you go to the Board?” 
[50] They also discussed when Mr. Friedmann could show the apartment to 
prospective tenants.  Ms. MacGarvie believ ed she gave him Saturday mornings and 
Friday evenings.  At that time, Mr. Friedmann also said he had come to her apartment on 
January 2.  Mr. Friedmann said that she was home, stating “I saw you – your bedroom 
door was closed and you were laying there.”  Ms. MacGarvie didn’t know how he could 
have seen her.  There was a window into the bedroom, but sh e kept her blinds closed. Ms. 
MacGarvie testified that she didn’t say anything to Mr. Friedmann about his comment 
regarding her lying in bed.   
[51] Ms. MacGarvie said that, at the time, she didn’t know if Mr. Friedmann went into 
her apartment when she wasn’t home.   Ho wever, based on things Mr. Friedmann had 
11 
2009 BCHRT 47 (CanLII)
said during the first hearing, she believed that  he had been in, or had seen her in, her 
apartment.  For example, Mr. Friedmann said  he did not understand  how a single woman, 
living alone, had four dinner plat es.  Ms. MacGarvie testified that he would have had to 
look into every single cupboard to know she ha d four dinner plates and she never gave 
him a tour of her cupboards.   As well, at th e first hearing, Mr. Friedmann said that all 
Ms. MacGarvie did was sit on th e couch and watch movies.  Ms.  MacGarvie said that she 
had blinds and drapes on the windows. 
[52] Thereafter, Ms. MacGarvie arranged fo r friends to be with her when Mr. 
Friedmann was coming over.  She wrote down w ho came to see the apartment.  The first 
time he was to show the apartment, Ms. MacGarvie’s friend ar rived.  When Mr. 
Friedmann saw her friend, he seemed confus ed.  Within five minutes, Mr. Friedmann 
said no one was coming and he left.  The next viewing day, Ms. MacGarvie had a friend 
and her friend’s husband over.   
[53] Ms. MacGarvie testified that Mr. Frie dmann had a hard time behaving himself 
when showing the apartment.  Ms. MacGarvi e made sure she didn’t say anything unless 
asked.  Mr. Friedmann made comments that made it clear that he hated Ms. MacGarvie 
and that she was a bad tenant.   
5. The Police Incident 
[54] When she moved in, there was a hole in Ms. MacGarvie’s bedroom ceiling.  After 
Ms. MacGarvie had given her notice, Mr. Frie dmann said he wanted to fill it in. Ms. 
MacGarvie arranged to have a friend ther e while the repairs were being done.  Mr. 
Friedmann came and did some repairs and said  he would come back to finish.  Ms. 
MacGarvie then called and left a message aski ng him to reschedule the remainder of the 
repairs.  
[55] On January 12, Ms. MacGarvie was sleep ing.  Mr. Friedmann knocked on the 
door.  He had all of his painting equipment w ith him.  Ms. MacGarvie testified that she 
believed that Mr. Friedmann knew she would be alone because it was an unscheduled 
appointment.  Ms. MacGarvie said she needed  a half-hour and Mr. Friedmann agreed.  
Ms. MacGarvie called a friend to come over, but her friend could not come right away.   
Mr. Friedmann came back before the half-hour  was up.  Ms. MacGarvie said “Hold on.”  
12 
2009 BCHRT 47 (CanLII)
Mr. Friedmann wouldn’t stop pounding on the door; he was becoming louder and more 
intimidating.  Ms. MacGarvie opened th e door and asked why he was being so 
disrespectful.  Mr. Friedmann didn’t say anythi ng; he just grabbed his materials and went 
into the bedroom. 
[56] Ms. MacGarvie testified that Mr. Friedmann saw her knocking on a neighbour’s 
door, and that she saw him smile because no one was home.  Ms. MacGarvie then went 
back into the apartment and called the Residential Tenanc y office, but couldn’t get 
through.  She called the non-emerge ncy police and they said she would have to call 911.   
[57] Ms. MacGarvie said to Mr. Friedmann “I have to go to work soon.”  Mr. 
Friedmann replied “Go, I don’t need you here.”  Ms. MacGarvie then told Mr. Friedmann 
that she had been advised to call 911 if he wouldn’t go.  Mr. Friedmann started yelling at 
her “You have mental problems – you are sick.  You see this hole?  This is your damage.  
You are a filthy animal.”  Then he went a nd pointed out the ceiling and said, “This is 
your damage.  You’re a fucking animal.”  Mr. Friedmann was so aggressive that Ms. 
MacGarvie was afraid for her safety, so she left the apartment and went to the front 
entrance.  She didn’t leave the building, as she didn’t have keys.  Mr. Friedmann stayed 
in Ms. MacGarvie’s apartment.  Ms. MacGarvie called 911.  While she was waiting for 
the police to arrive, Mr. Friedmann remained inside the apartment.   
[58] When the police came, they returned to the apartment.  Mr. Friedmann was on a 
ladder.  He was startled to see the policemen  but continued painting.  The police officers 
asked Mr. Friedmann to come down and talk to them.  Mr. Friedmann said, “I have 
nothing to say.  This woman is the problem.  She called you and you can talk to her.”  
Mr. Friedmann lost his temper when the police insisted that he leave the apartment.  He started calling Ms. MacGarvie names like “fuc king animal.”  She could hear him yelling 
from the entranceway.  Ms. MacGarvie was frightened, she could barely talk, and was 
crying.  She told the police that Mr. Friedma nn had hit a woman with a baseball bat and 
that they could look him up.   
[59] The constable said that from now on, Mr. Friedmann could not go in to the 
apartment.  Ms. MacGarvie didn’t want Mr. Frie dmann to be vengeful, so she said that he 
could come into the apartmen t provided she had 24 hours notice.   Ms. MacGarvie told the 
13 
2009 BCHRT 47 (CanLII)
police that Mr. Friedmann was giving her gifts.  Ms. MacGarvie testified that she was 
terrified, and that the police said they would do extra patrols.  
[60] Ms. MacGarvie provided a copy of police do cuments regarding this incident.  The 
Occurrence Report states:  
On 05-01-12 at approximately 1015 hrs complainant MacGarvie called 
Police to report that her landlord Frie dman was in her residence at 1629 E. 
10th and was yelling at her.  MacGarvie st ates that Friedman is angry at her 
as she is moving out at the end of the month.   
PC’s arrived on scene and spoke with MacGarvie who stated that 
Friedman had began yelling at her when she asked for her damage deposit back.  MacGarvie believes that Fr iedman has acted inappropriately by 
giving her candy and other gifts in the pa st and saying that he just wanted 
to be her friend. 
Friedman was advised that he was no  longer allowed in MacGarvie’s suite 
unless she invited him in and must give 24 hrs notice prior to showing the suite. 
Both parties were advised that the damage deposit is a civil matter and 
they should seek advise from the tenancy branch. 
This concludes PC’s involvemen t.  (reproduced as written) 
[61] Ms. MacGarvie testifie d that she was really disappoint ed with the report.  It does 
not refer to the interaction between Mr. Friedmann and police.  They had to yell at him, 
telling him it was not his apartment – it was her apartment.  When Mr. Friedmann was 
taken out of apartment, he ranted about what a horrible tenant she was.  Ms. MacGarvie 
said she never said anything to the police a bout candy.  Mr. Friedmann never said he just 
wanted to be her friend, and Ms. MacGarvie never used those words.  Ms. MacGarvie 
mentioned to the police that Mr. Friedmann th reatened to sue her and possibly take her 
damage deposit.   
[62] The police constable who attended the apartment and wrote the report was not 
called as a witness.   
[63] In any event, Ms. MacGarvie testified that Mr. Friedmann took his things and left, 
and that he knew he had to give Ms. MacG arvie 24 hours notice before reentering her 
14 
2009 BCHRT 47 (CanLII)
apartment.  The police stayed in front of the building for some time.  Then her friend 
arrived and she was able to calm down.   
6. Moving Out 
[64] Ms. MacGarvie provided a letter from Mr . Friedmann to her, dated January 14, 
2005.  This was the first notice from Mr. Friedm ann in regard to showing the apartment.  
It stated:   
Please be advise that I will be showing the apartment #1 – 1629 E. 10th 
Ave. Van. For new prospective tenant. 
Friday, January 14 05 at 6:00 p.m. 
Saturday, January 16, 05 at 2: 00 p.m. (reproduced as written) 
[65] Ms. MacGarvie received th e next notice from Mr. Friedmann on January 20, 
2005.  It stated:  
Please be advice that I will show apartment #1 – 1629 E. 10th Ave. for new 
prospective tenants on Saturday Jan. 22 at 3:00 p.m. Sunday Jan. 23 at 
2:00 p.m. (reproduced as written) 
[66] Ms. MacGarvie arranged for a friend to be with her when Mr. Friedmann showed 
the apartment.  She testified that when ente ring with one prospective female tenant, he 
came to see Ms. MacGarvie in the living room and said “When can I fix the damages you 
made?”  Ms. MacGarvie replied words to the effect of, “No, J ohn.  You know you can’t 
come to my apartment because the police or dered you to only show the apartment and 
give 24 hours notice and you haven’t fixed things  in the year I’ve b een here and I think 
you can wait.” 
[67] Ms. MacGarvie moved out on January 31.  She hired a truck with two movers.   
She wanted a lot of people around.  She al so talked to the police again.  They 
recommended that an officer attend to keep the peace.  Ms. MacGarvie called the police, 
but they came too late. 
[68]  When Ms. MacGarvie finished cleaning the apartment, she went around with a 
video camera.  Ms. MacGarvie handed the keys  to Mr. Friedmann.  He  said he was going 
15 
2009 BCHRT 47 (CanLII)
to check the apartment, so Ms. MacGarvie turned on the camera.  Ms. MacGarvie said 
that she took pictures and videotaped her apartment because Mr. Friedmann had said he 
was going to blame her for the condition of the apartment and was threatening to sue her.  
They inspected the apartment together. When  he was done checking, Ms. MacGarvie left.  
[69] Ms. MacGarvie introduced a videotape into  evidence.  It showed her apartment 
and the clean condition it was in when she left . It also showed th at Ms. MacGarvie had 
left all of Mr. Friedmann’s gifts at the apartment. 
[70] During her testimony, Ms. MacGarvie was as ked why she felt that she had been 
discriminated against, as opposed to Mr. Fr iedmann being a problematic landlord.  She 
testified that in her view, Mr. Friedmann was easily intimidated by men.  She did not 
notice him bullying, keeping damage deposits,  not returning damage deposits or being 
controlling with male tenants, but he did it consistently with female tenants.   
[71] Ms. MacGarvie was asked why she hadn’t left earlier.  When Mr. Friedmann 
became very controlling, especially about her male guest and asking about her love life, 
Ms. MacGarvie knew she had to leave.  She te stified that once she realized she had to 
leave, she gave Mr. Friedmann her notice.      
7. Aftermath 
[72] Ms. MacGarvie testified th at she gave Mr. Friedmann the Vancouver Eastside 
Women’s Centre as her forwar ding address because she was given legal advice to do so 
and because she did not want to put her friends  at a disadvantage by giving their address.  
She did not want to give Mr. Friedmann her own address – she had been very scared of 
Mr. Friedmann and once he received the human rights complaint, she was worried that he 
would try to find her.   
[73] Mr. Friedmann sent Ms. MacGarvie a cheque  to the Eastside Women’s Centre for 
her damage deposit, less $40 for cleaning the bathroom ceiling and for replacing painted 
outlets in the bathroom.  Ms. MacGarvie te stified that she took the cheque to Mr. 
Friedmann’s branch, who told her that the ch eque would bounce if sh e tried to cash it.  
She went to the bank two or three times to s ee if the cheque would cl ear.  She believed it 
did go through after Mr. Friedmann recei ved her human rights complaint.   
16 
2009 BCHRT 47 (CanLII)
8. Events after Ms. MacGarvie filed her human rights complaint 
[74] Ms. MacGarvie testified that  she believed that Mr. Friedmann tried to contact her 
after she filed her human rights complaint.  Her employer told her that a potential 
employer called for a reference. Ms. MacGar vie testified that she believed it was Mr. 
Friedmann from her employer’s description of  the caller’s accent, the questions asked, 
and because she had not applied for any othe r jobs.  Ms. MacGarvie said that she was 
told that the caller did not ask employment -related questions but rather more personal 
questions designed to find out where she was.  For example, the caller tried to find out 
what building she worked in.  
[75] As well, in Mr. Friedmann’s response to Ms . MacGarvie’s complaint, he said that 
once he received the human rights complaint,  he went to Ms. MacGarvie’s forwarding 
address to speak to Ms. MacGarvie’s new landlord.  Ms. MacGarvie felt that Mr. 
Friedmann would try to defame her, cause problems with her new landlord, and intimidate her not to pursue the complaint.  He had no other reason to try to contact her.  Ms. MacGarvie testified that she sent a letter dated Ap ril 1, 2005, to Mr. Friedmann as a 
result of this incident, which states: 
Please be advised that I am being re present by the Human Rights Clinic in 
regards to the case I have filed agai nst you.  I have been made aware of 
your phone call to my employer, which is inappropriate, and any further 
questions or concerns you may have  needs to be addressed through my 
lawyer.  (reproduced as written) 
9. Mr. Friedmann’s Response to the Complaint  
[76] In his response to Ms. MacGarvie’s complaint, Mr. Friedmann said:   
This woman is has serious health problem, lazy, lier, bad character.  She 
had a lot of problem before and she is doing same again and again.  Deportation order out of Canada is on ly right decision.  She was only who 
breech Tenancy Agreement, no landlord. 
… 
… I am doing good service and maintenance but I do not provide medical treatment for ill people.  When I interviewed Ms. MacGarvie, she told me she is Spanish and she was from Barcelona and that she had lots of 
17 
2009 BCHRT 47 (CanLII)
problems.  I asked what kind of problems and she never answered me.  She 
promised she is a clean woman and will be a good tenant.  She was a very bad tenant, a liar and causing intenti onal problems.  I am very happy with 
my decision.  I do not have rent for these people and anybody like them. 
When I received this paper, I went to address that she gave me at 302 
Columbia for I wanted to talk to he r new landlord.  I was shocked when I 
saw over 100 women inside.  I went out  and read the sign outside and it 
says “Vancouver East Side Women Centre.” 
Congratulations, Madam MacGarvie, this  is the right place for you before 
you get deportation order out of Canada. 
At 28 years old, she is unable  to take care of herself.  She is dealing only 
with RCMP, Mexican police, lawyers, welfare officials and Vancouver East Side Women Centre.  She will never be a good citizen in this country. (reproduced as written) 
10. Mr. Friedmann’s Behaviour during the Complaint Process 
[77] Ms. MacGarvie testified that Mr. Friedmann sent a series of letters begging people 
to stop helping her to pursue her complaint, requesting that she be checked by a 
psychiatrist and otherwise defaming her.   
[78] First, she referred to Mr. Friedmann’ s letter of May 3, 2006, which was in 
response to Ms. MacGarvie’s application for co sts.  Mr. Friedmann suggested that it was 
Ms. MacGarvie who sexually harassed him in  hope of obtaining free rent, but he was not 
interested in her adva nces.  Ms. MacGarvie denied this allegation and said that this was 
the first and only time it was mentioned.  In  that letter, Mr. Friedmann requested the 
Tribunal’s opinion concerning: 
Ms. MacGarvie’s psychological capacity  for rational thought as, in my 
opinion, she has acted irrationally and w ithout due cause.  I would request 
that the Tribunal order a psychologi cal evaluation of Ms. MacGarvie 
before further proceeding with the allegations against me.   
[79] Ms. MacGarvie also referred to a letter written by Mr . Friedmann to the Tribunal 
on June 15, 2006.  This letter wa s written after the first hear ing had been cancelled and a 
new hearing had been scheduled for late July, and states: 
18 
2009 BCHRT 47 (CanLII)
I would like to request for my hearing start July 24, 2006 a Jury – panels 
with min. of three people. 
I have concerns about Tribunal H eather MacNaughton because of past 
experience.  They hate my name .  Enough is enough.  I have 27 years 
experience with the Resi dential Tenancy office – Vancouver Police and 
Supreme Court also.  This case itself  is evidence of the discrimination 
against me, and I am sick of it.  The former Tribunal lost control of herself 
(yelling at me).  I never met this women …… anywhere.  This is laying 
[lying?]  I do not have trust in your  office at all.  Nobody advise me on 
preliminary hearing on June 2, 2006. 
I am asking Tribunal with experien ce of Gypsy origin, also experience 
with tenancy on east side of Vancouver.  (reproduced as written; also cc’d 
to Attorney General) 
[80] Ms. MacGarvie also referred to  a letter from Mr. Friedmann to the Tribunal, dated 
August 24, 2006.  On the “Re” line it states: “N oemi MacGarvie aka Hernandez, Perez, 
Gonzales v. John Friedman.”  In this letter , Mr. Friedmann referred to a witness of Ms. 
MacGarvie’s that he did not want  to testify and a witness of his that he did want to testify 
(both of these witnesses did testify eventually).  After setting out his concerns, Mr. 
Friedmann went on to state: 
Again, I have not broken any laws.  I am upset as well as innocent.  I am a very good landlord.  My record is perfect as I live for 28 years on same 
area of east side of Vancouver.  I never collect one penny from this Government. 
My one mistake is that I did no t check the references of Noemi 
MacGarvie.  I gave her a chance a nd trusted her promise to be a good 
tenant.  She was a very bad tenant.  At 28 years old, she owned balangy [?] 
worth $200 which she mostly picked up from alleys.  He bank is in Ontario.  She travels across the c ountry, seeking all adventure, free 
education, welfare, layers and had lots of experien ce on Human Rights 
law.  I am not the first victim of this woman.  She is a danger to the 
society.  For this reason, I want a telephone conversation between myself, the Tribunal and the Complainant.  It is  important for justice that I be able 
to check her renting and personal history. (reproduced as written) 
[81] Mr. Friedmann also wrote to Community Legal Assistance Society (who are Ms. 
MacGarvie’s counsel) on January 19, 2007.  Th e “Re” line stated “Complain on N. 
MacGarvie Assistance”.  The letter states: 
19 
2009 BCHRT 47 (CanLII)
You provide a lawyer Judith Doulis in  her Human Right case.  I want you  
inform you that this women only got into the apartment building what I 
mange because she lied.  She mad pr omises that she was clean and she 
would be a very good tenant.  She al so told me that she had a lot of 
problems before. 
MacGarvie only lived two years in Vancouver, she has traveled (paid[?]) 
all across the country ta king advantage of the government’s social welfare 
system: free education, layers etc.  Bank account in Ottawa, address: East 
Side Women Centre.  She is very u nhappy from herself.  This women is 
very dangeros to our society.  $200 balangy [?] from alley. 
I am 100% sure that I am not the firs t victim of this woman and certain 
that I will not be the last, and it is up to you to stop this criminal.  They are 
responsible for my injury, I can’t work today. 
My record on the East Side of Vanc ouver for the last twenty-nine years 
has been perfect.  I do many good services and I never break any laws. 
Please check her previous references and cancel her legal assistance.  (reproduced as written; cc’d  to Attorney General) 
11. Mr. Friedmann’s Behaviour during the First Hearing 
[82] Ms. MacGarvie described delays during the first hearing.  The hearing, originally 
scheduled for October 2005, was first adjourne d at Mr. Friedmann’s request because he 
was trying to get legal representation.   
[83] At the first day of the hearing, Mr. Fr iedmann said he had not received any 
documents from Ms. MacGarvie’s counsel, so  they could not proceed. However, Ms. 
MacGarvie was able to obtain proof that Mr. Friedmann had received the documents and 
the hearing resumed.  This delaye d the hearing se veral hours.   
[84] In an affidavit Ms. MacGarvie had sworn in May 2006 in support of her 
application for costs, Ms. MacGarvie referred to  further delay, when after several days of 
hearing, Mr. Friedmann requested an  interpreter.  She said that he had participated in the 
hearing up to that point, entirely  in English.  As well, she said  that all of he r dealings with 
him had been in English and that he always appeared to understand what she was saying. 
20 
2009 BCHRT 47 (CanLII)
[85] Ms. MacGarvie also noted that Mr. Fr iedmann objected to every one of her 
witnesses. 
[86] Ms. MacGarvie referred to the events leading to the Member recusing herself 
from the first hearing.  In her affidavit in s upport of her costs app lication, she stated the 
following: 
I am advised by my legal counsel that the hearing must now be heard anew 
with a different Tribunal Member because Mr. Friedmann followed [the 
Tribunal Member] on April 7, 2006, and approached her in a 
confrontational manner.   
[87] In Ms. MacGarvie’s application for costs dated May 12, 2006, Ms. MacGarvie’s 
counsel recounted in submissions why the hearing had to be rescheduled: 
On April 13, 2006, [the Registrar] of the BC Human Rights Tribunal, 
contacted Counsel for the parties to schedule an emergency telephone 
conference later that day.  
At the telephone conference, the Regi strar informed Counsel that the 
continuation of the hearing of the Complaint scheduled for April 29, 2006, had to be cancelled.  She further advised Counsel that the Complaint had to be reheard in its entirety before  a new Tribunal Member.  The Registrar 
further informed Counsel that the re ason for having to order a new hearing 
of the Complaint was due to the con duct of the Respondent.  Specifically, 
the Respondent followed [the Tribunal  Member] and approached her in a 
confrontational manner and wrote dow n the licence number of the car 
which she occupied at the time.  As a result of this incident, the Tribunal 
involved the police. 
[88] Ms. MacGarvie testified th at Mr. Friedmann’s conduct made her very worried 
about her own safety.  She also referred to  Mr. Friedmann’s response to the cost 
application where he wrote: 
… Furthermore, and contrary to [the  Tribunal Member’s] claims, I have 
not been in the parking lot of the downtown Robson & Denman St. 
Safeway, and thus I could not have had a confrontation at that place. 
I ask the Tribunal to stop Ms. MacG arvie because she is not good for our 
society.  I only wasn’t Justice.  Sh e is a menace to Society and I am an 
honest, hardworking person. (reproduced as written) 
21 
2009 BCHRT 47 (CanLII)
[89] In Mr. Friedmann’s response to Ms. MacG arvie’s costs application, he said the 
following about his witnesses: 
… While the Tribunal has admitted Ms. MacGarvie’s witnesses, my 
witnesses have not been allowed to a ssist me in my case.  These include 
my banker, with whom I have frequent and honest dealings, as well as former tenants who would testify on my behalf.  I have no idea why my 
witnesses were disqualified while th ose of Ms. MacGarvie are allowed to 
present their respective cases.  In rega rds to this peculiarity, I feel I am 
being discriminated.  (reproduced as written) 
[90] In response to this comment, Ms. MacGar vie testified that Mr. Friedmann had no 
witnesses come in person, but he did come w ith several letters, from his bank and other 
tenants.  This is what he cons idered to be his witnesses.  The Tribunal Member in the first 
hearing said the letters would be accepted for a limited purpose.  For example, the letter 
from the bank mentioned he had brought them  flowers, so the Member accepted it as 
evidence for that, but not as general evidence of his character.   
12. Mr. Friedmann’s Behaviour during the Second Hearing 
[91] Ms. MacGarvie testified that  after she left the apartment, she had not had any 
direct contact with Mr. Friedmann except at the hearings.  Two incidents occurred during 
the second hearing. 
[92] During the first incident, Mr. Friedm ann saw Ms. MacGarvie when she was 
entering the building.  He rushed to meet her and called her “fucking garbage”.  Ms. 
MacGarvie found this upsetting.  Although her concerns had subsided over time, Ms. 
MacGarvie was still concerned about her safety.  She did not know the lengths to which Mr. Friedmann would go.  He went out of his way to confront her and was abusive.  I 
directed Mr. Friedmann during the heari ng not to speak to Ms. MacGarvie.   
[93] On another day, Ms. MacGarvie had come up the elevator to the floor where the 
hearing was being held.  Because  no one was there, she went to leave.  The elevator door 
opened, and Mr. Friedmann was inside.  Ms. MacG arvie testified that he  appeared to look 
out to see if anyone else was there with her.   Ms. MacGarvie felt that there would have 
been a confrontation if Mr. Friedmann had known  no one else was there.  Later that day, 
22 
2009 BCHRT 47 (CanLII)
Mr. Friedmann came out of a boardroom and star ted to approach her with a sort of smile 
on his face.  The Tribunal employee at re ception asked him what he wanted and 
redirected him elsewhere.  Ms. MacGarvie testified that she had a feeling that Mr. 
Friedmann wanted to confront her when sh e was not surrounded by people.  That was 
why, in the last couple of mont hs of her tenancy, she wanted  to make sure she would not 
be alone.   
[94] Ms. MacGarvie also felt that Mr. Frie dmann was trying to delay the second 
hearing.   Ms. MacGarvie testified that in  her view, Mr. Friedma nn tried to find every 
possible way to block the hearing from going ahead, including by providing doctor’s 
notes and not having a lawyer.    
[95] Ms. MacGarvie also testified that it had been an awkward experience with 
witnesses.  She said that people told her that they did not want to get involved because 
they did not want problems with Mr. Friedm ann.  One potential witness would not take 
part unless his evidence was anonymous.  A couple of witnesses refused to come if Mr. 
Friedmann was anywhere near the buildi ng.  Although she had obtained an Order to 
Appear for a witness who was still a tenant , Ms. MacGarvie testif ied that the witness 
asked her not to pursue the Order to Appear at  the hearing because he  was concerned that 
his tenancy situation with Mr. Friedmann wo uld become worse.  Ms. MacGarvie also 
believes that Ms. Matias was subpoenaed to test ify as Mr. Friedmann’s witness, and came 
unwillingly.   
13. Impact on Ms. MacGarvie 
[96] In regard to the impact her experien ce with Mr. Friedmann had on her, Ms. 
MacGarvie testified that she felt her privacy had been trampled and that Mr. Friedmann 
used his power as a landlord to make sexua l innuendoes, but that she couldn’t say much 
because she had to have a reasonable relati onship with him because he was her landlord. 
[97] Ms. MacGarvie had told Mr. Friedmann about  her financial conc erns and that she 
wanted the apartment for a long term.  He al so knew that she did not have many friends 
or family in Vancouver.  Once she moved in, Mr. Friedmann seemed very sure he had a right to pursue her, bring her gifts, ask her out; even though she was short with him and 
23 
2009 BCHRT 47 (CanLII)
unresponsive.  Ms. MacGarvie sa id that it was hard to keep things appropriate without 
Mr. Friedmann getting angry.   
[98] The circumstances were extremely upsetting by the time she left the apartment.  
Ms. MacGarvie testified that Mr. Friedmann was angry because he did not think she was 
going to go through with moving out.  He wa s very nice in November and assumed she 
was going to stay.  However, once Ms. MacG arvie gave her notice, he became very 
abusive and tried to find ways to bully and punish her.  Mr. Friedmann did not let her 
leave in peace and dignity – he was vindictive, punishing, taking out his anger and 
keeping part of her damage deposit. 
[99] Ms. MacGarvie was also afraid Mr. Friedm ann would lie to her new landlord who 
would try to evict her.  She was afraid th at Mr. Friedmann woul d call her old rental 
references and ruin her reputation and that she would be left with no references.   
[100]  Ms. MacGarvie said that her last three years in Vancouver have been challenging.  
In the first couple of months  after she moved out, she was very highly stressed.  She 
rarely goes to Commercial drive, which was close to the apartment, although she loves the area. It has almost been overwhelming in arranging time to come to the hearings and 
being concerned about her safety.  She wanted  to leave it behind a nd go on with her life, 
but believed that Mr. Friedm ann was hurting people.     
[101]  With regard to his various letters, Ms. M acGarvie testified that she believed that 
Mr. Friedmann was trying to discredit her, including by po rtraying her as someone on 
social assistance and by suggesting that she had several last names.  She also felt that Mr. 
Friedmann was trying to derail the hearing and to bully and intimidate the Tribunal.  She 
testified that Mr. Friedmann was trying to ruin  her name and every as pect of her life.   
[102]  Ms. MacGarvie also testified that it was frustrating that Mr. Friedmann would not 
come to the hearing and defend himself.  She be lieved that he will continue to try to bully 
and scare her and try to find any means possible to discredit her.  Sh e had concerns about 
future encounters with Mr. Friedmann as a re sult of pursing her human rights complaint.  
She was also concerned that if there is a decision in her favour, Mr. Friedmann will retaliate against her.   
24 
2009 BCHRT 47 (CanLII)
Other Witnesses  
[103]  As noted at the outset of these reasons , at the time of the hearing, Heather 
Thompson, Lauren Thewlis, Rebecca Brazier, Vanessa Zemluk, Asha Marie MacDonald, 
Stephen Good and Maria Matias were former or  current tenants of Mr. Friedmann.  Each 
of them gave evidence about their own expe riences with Mr. Friedmann.  Ms. MacGarvie 
submitted that these witnesses’ experiences are evidence of a pattern of behaviour, that is, 
Mr. Friedmann making inappropriate comment s and bullying young, female tenants.   
[104]  Diana Thomson, who was not Mr. Friedmann’s tenant, testified regarding events 
which led to her receiving injuries as a result  of Mr. Friedmann hit ting her with a baseball 
bat.  Ms. MacGarvie testified th at she knew of this incident, and that it caused  her to fear 
Mr. Friedmann.   
[105]  Mr. Friedmann was unrepresented during th e times he was present at the hearing 
(July 2006).  He did not object  to the witnesses giving evidence, and I allowed them to 
testify.  However, I have concerns about the use to which Ms. MacGarvie submits I 
should put their evidence.     
[106]   The Tribunal has a broad di scretion under s. 27.2(1) of the Code  to accept 
evidence that the member considers necessa ry and appropriate, whether or not that 
evidence would be admissible in a court pro ceeding.  However, the Tribunal approaches 
evidence that may amount to similar fact evid ence with caution.  As the Tribunal 
explained in Willis v. Blencoe, 2001 BCHRT 12:  
As a general rule, it is not appropriate to admit similar fact evidence to 
bolster an argument that a respondent has a propensity which makes it 
more likely than not that he or she engaged in the alleged conduct. Applied in this context, it would not be appropriate to admit similar fact 
evidence to show that the respondent is the type of character that is likely 
to have sexually harassed a complainant.  
It may, however, be appropriate, and necessary, to hear similar fact 
evidence in cases where the respondent puts his or her good character in issue, or where the similar fact evidence goes to bolster the credibility of a witness. In such cases, si milar fact evidence that demonstrates a pattern of 
conduct that is unique or distinctive and coincides with some unique or distinctive pattern alleged in the case before the adjudicator should be, and is, admitted. The question the adjudicator must ask is whether the 
25 
2009 BCHRT 47 (CanLII)
probative value of the evidence outwei ghs its prejudicial effect. (paras. 910) 
[107]   I have no concerns about Ms. MacGarvie’s credibility and have accepted her 
evidence in its entirety, so th ere is no need for me to rely on evidence of a pattern of 
conduct in order to bolster he r credibility.  While Mr. Friedmann put his character at 
issue, he ultimately did not testify.  Also, Ms. MacGarvie has not filed a systemic or 
group discrimination complaint.  Heather Th ompson testified that  she filed her own 
human rights complaint, but it was not accep ted by the Tribunal because it was out of 
time.  None of the other witnesses testif ied that they filed their own human rights 
complaints.   
[108]  Because Mr. Friedmann did not object to the evidence and ultimately did not 
participate in the remainder of the hearing, I had no submissions before me regarding the 
evidence’s potentially prejudicial impact  and whether this impact outweighed its 
probative value.    
[109]  Because Ms. MacGarvie’s evidence is un controverted and I have no concerns 
about her credibility, it is not necessary for me to consider the other tenants’ evidence for the purposes of establishing a pattern of behaviour.  Therefore, in all of the 
circumstances, I have determined that it is not necessary for me to determine whether the 
other tenants’ evidence con cerning Mr. Friedmann’s alleged treatment of them meets the 
evidentiary test for admissi ble similar fact evidence. 
[110]  However, some of the other tenants’ evidence and Diana Thompson’s evidence 
corroborated Ms. MacGarvie’s te stimony on certain points or was generally of assistance 
in putting Ms. MacGarvie’s reactions to the various alleged instances of harassment and 
discrimination into context. Also, Ms. Brazi er, Ms. Zemluk and Mr. Good gave evidence 
regarding Mr. Friedmann’s comments to them  about Ms. MacGarvie,  and Ms. Brazier, 
Ms. Zemluk, Ms. MacDonald and Mr. Good tes tified that Mr. Friedmann pressured them 
to support him in response to Ms. MacGar vie’s human rights complaint.     
[111]  I am satisfied that each of the witnesses tes tified to the best of their ability.  It is 
possible that, for some of them, their memory  was not completely accurate, due to the 
passage of time.  As well, some of them may have at times unintentionally exaggerated 
26 
2009 BCHRT 47 (CanLII)
their evidence, but overall, wh ere these witnesses had direct knowledge of certain events, 
I accepted their evidence as reliable.  In re gard to Mr. Friedmann’s one witness, Ms. 
Matias, since she was still a tenant of Mr. Friedmann, I treated her evidence with some 
caution for that reason as well.  However, ove rall, I am satisfied based on the principles 
set out by the BC Cour t of Appeal in Faryna v. Chorny , [1952] 2 D.L.R. 354 that the 
witnesses were credible.   
[112]  Although a great deal of evidence was given by the other tenants and Diana 
Thomson, because of the purposes for which I accep t that evidence, I do not refer to all of 
it in these reasons, although I have reviewed all of the evidence carefully.   
Heather Thompson 
[113]  Ms. MacGarvie testified that Heather Thompson was present when Mr. 
Friedmann said “Oh, look at these beautiful women, my tenants.  I am looking for a wife, because no one wants to marry me”, and Ms. MacGarvie described Ms. Thompson as 
looking uncomfortable. Ms. Thompson gave very little evidence about this incident.  She testified that once on the fr ont lawn, Mr. Friedmann said something about beautiful 
women and no one wanting to marry him.  It was unclear whether sh e was describing the 
same incident as Ms. MacGarvie.  
[114]  The remainder of Ms. Thompson’s eviden ce concerned Mr. Friedmann’s alleged 
treatment of her.  Because I have determined  that this evidence is not necessary to the 
disposition of Ms. MacGarvie’ s complaint, I do not set that evidence out here.   
Lauren Thewlis 
[115]  Lauren Thewlis testified that she only  met Ms. MacGarvie once while she was a 
tenant, and neither she nor Ms. MacGarvie test ified that they discussed Mr. Friedmann’s 
behaviour.  Ms. Thewlis also did not give evid ence that would be poten tially relevant to 
Ms. MacGarvie’s costs application.  Rather , her evidence was primarily regarding Mr. 
Friedmann’s alleged treatment of her.  For th e reasons given above, it is not necessary for 
me to refer to Ms. Thewlis’ evidence on this issue.

Rebecca Brazier 
[116]  Rebecca Brazier moved into Ms. MacGar vie’s apartment after Ms. MacGarvie 
left.  Prior to the hearing, she had not  spoken to Ms. MacGarvie, although Ms. 
MacGarvie was present in the apartmen t when Ms. Brazier viewed it.   
[117]  Ms. Brazier testified that Mr. Friedmann sa id he did not like Ms. MacGarvie, that 
she was troublesome and did not take care of the apartment.  Mr. Friedmann said she lied, 
that she said she was Spanish from Barcel ona and that he found out she was Mexican.  
Mr. Friedmann said that Mexicans are dirty and bad and caused trouble.  He also called 
her crazy.   
[118]  Mr. Friedmann also told Ms. Brazier that  Ms. MacGarvie had a boyfriend move in 
without asking permission, and that he did not  like that.  Mr. Frie dmann said one time 
that he met Ms. MacGarvie’s friend in the hall.  Apparently Ms. MacGarvie’s friend 
wanted to shake Mr. Friedmann’s hand.  He told Ms. Brazier that he took it as an insult, 
because apparently younger men don’t offer to shake an older man’s hand in Eastern Europe.   
[119]  Ms. Brazier also testified about a letter she wrote, dated March 29, 2005.  This 
letter was addressed “To whom  it may concern” and states: 
I have been a tenant in apartment #1 since February 2005.  My dealings 
with John Friedman up to date have b een few.  He did fix my oven shortly 
after I asked him to, and had other wise been an agreeable landlord.  If you 
have any further questions, pleas e feel free to contact me.  
(signed by Ms. Brazier) 
P.S.  I was witness to a very poor an d unfinished paint job in the apartment 
when I viewed it in January. 
[120]  Ms. Brazier was asked how the letter cam e about.  She said it happened sometime 
after she had signed the lease.  Mr. Friedmann asked for it because he needed a character 
reference “that he was a good guy”.  Ms. Brazier had only been living in the apartment for a couple of months and Mr. Friedmann had been fine up to that point.  Ms. Brazier 
agreed to do it because she did not want to rock the boat.  After she provided letter, Mr. 
28 
2009 BCHRT 47 (CanLII)
Friedmann asked her to add that she had seen a bad paint job in the bedroom and 
something on the bathroom ceiling that Ms. MacGarvie was responsible for, so Ms. 
Brazier added a post script saying that.  Ms. Brazier testified that she didn’t really want to 
write the letter but Mr. Friedmann was he r landlord and she felt compelled to do it. 
[121]  Ms. Brazier wrote another letter in s upport of Mr. Friedmann, which is dated 
December 11, 2005 and addressed “To Whom It  May Concern”.  The letter states: 
My name is Rebecca Brazier and I am a former tenant of 1629 E. 10th Ave.  
In Feb 2005 I signed a lease with John Frieman for one year.  After a brief 
discussion with Mr. Frieman on Novemb er 7, 2005 it was agreed that he 
would release me from my lease, if we  were able to find a new tenant for 
Dec. 01/05.  After I placed an ad on line for the apartment there was a 
large response and the apartment was qui ckly rented again.  As a result I 
was released from my lease acc ordingly and as of today (Sunday 
December 11, 2005) my full damage deposit was returned in cash.  
[122]  Ms. Brazier testified that she wrote the letter after she gave notice.  Mr. 
Friedmann told her he wanted another charac ter reference for a proceeding.  He wanted 
the letter to state that Ms. Brazier had aske d out of lease early and he obliged.  Ms. 
Brazier had been having trouble getting her da mage deposit back and did not get it back 
until she provided the letter.  Ms. Brazier testified that sh e did not want to give Mr. 
Friedmann another letter of reference.  She di d not really want to help him out any more, 
but was afraid she would not get her damage deposit back. 
[123]  During the first hearing, Mr. Friedmann was represented by a law student.  The 
student asked Ms. Brazier to te stify.  She told the student th at she was not interested in 
testifying for Mr. Friedmann, that she did not  have the best experience at the apartment 
building and did not want  to help him out.   
[124]  Ms. Brazier ran into Mr. Friedmann on the street and he asked why she would not 
testify, saying to her that he was a good man and asking her why was she doing this.  Ms. 
Brazier said she did not feel right testifying for him, that  she had nothing good to say on 
his behalf.  Ms. Brazier finally had to end the conversation.

2009 BCHRT 47 (CanLII)
Vanessa Zemluk 
[125]  Ms. Zemluk testified that Mr. Friedmann co mplained to her about other tenants.  
Ms. Zemluk thought he complained about Ms. MacGarvie, but she di d not remember any 
specifics.  He complained about a girl dow nstairs who had a cat, a boyfriend who came to 
stay too often, too many people coming through.   He referred to the number of men who 
came through in a number of months and peopl e being pigs, but Ms. Zemluk was not sure 
if any of this was in specific reference to Ms. MacGarvie.  She also testified that there 
was also another incident when  someone moved in who said they were Spanish and were 
actually Mexican and Mr. Friedmann went on a tirade.  Ms. Zemluk testified that she did not know if these comments related to Ms. MacGarvie.   
[126]  Ms. Zemluk also testified that Mr. Frie dmann asked her to write him letters of 
reference.  In a letter dated March 29, 2005 and addressed “To whom it may concern”, 
Ms. Zemluk wrote: 
I am a resident at 1629 east 10th Ave. where Jon Friedmann is my 
Landlord.  As student I a ppreciate his determination to maintain a quiet, 
safe and friendly building.  During the tim e that I have lived here we have 
often talked about sports particular ly hockey, something Mr. Friedmann is 
quite knowledgeable in.  Jon has values based in respect and community, 
this is something that he has talked  about and that he displayed to me 
when he prepared a delicious turkey  for the apartment building shortly 
after Christmas.  During the time that I have lived here I have felt comfortable around Mr. Friedmann and the building that he maintains. 
[127]  Ms. Zemluk said that this was the second letter of reference that she wrote for Mr. 
Friedmann.  He came and asked for a letter at a time when Ms. Zemluk was not sure if 
she was going to stay in her apartment.  She was quite reluctant to write the letter.  Mr. 
Friedmann had often treated her roommate with hostility.  She first wrote a neutral letter 
that she had not had any problems with Mr. Friedmann.  Mr. Friedmann said the letter was not good enough and gave her a “sob stor y”.  Ms. Zemluk then wrote the March 29
th 
letter.  She did not particular ly want to write it.  However, she felt that Mr. Friedmann 
was her landlord and if she didn’t write the letter, it might  jeopardize her tenancy.   
[128]  Mr. Friedmann told Ms. Zemluk that “peopl e were out to get him” and that he 
needed her help.  Specifically  with regard to Ms. MacGar vie’s human rights complaint, 
30 
2009 BCHRT 47 (CanLII)
he said that she was no good, not to  be trusted, and out to get him.  He also talked about 
Ms. MacGarvie wrecking the apartm ent and just leaving it.   
[129]  At one point, Mr. Friedmann called Ms. Zeml uk’s parents’ house to try to get help 
from Ms. Zemluk’s father.  He offered to pay in exchange for supporting him in the case.   
[130]  Ms. Zemluk testified that Mr. Friedmann had also tried to blackmail her by saying 
that she had taken some furniture from the alleyway.  Mr. Friedmann was trying to get 
Ms. Zemluk’s support in defence of Ms. MacG arvie’s human rights complaint, but this 
after he had called Ms. Zemluk’s roommate (Ms. MacDonald) a “fucki ng bitch” because 
she had refused to help Mr. Friedmann.  Ms.  Zemluk asked Mr. Friedmann how he could 
treat people like that and expect them to vouch for his character.  Then Mr. Friedmann 
accused her of taking furniture from the alleyway.   
Asha Marie MacDonald 
[131]  Ms. MacDonald, who was Ms. Zemluk’s roommate, also gave evidence that Mr. 
Friedmann tried to pressure her to support him in his defence ag ainst Ms. MacGarvie’s 
human rights complaint.   
[132]  Ms. MacDonald testified th at Mr. Friedmann telephoned her shortly after he 
found out that he was going to the hearing and asked Ms. MacDonald to support him.  
Ms. MacDonald sort of brushed it off, telling him that she did not have time to talk about 
it.  Ms. MacDonald thought the conversation was over, but a few weeks later Mr. 
Friedmann phoned back and asked again.  Ms. MacDonald said she did not have time to help him.  Mr. Friedmann then called her a “fucking bitch”.  Ms. MacDonald hung up, and thereafter would not answer the phone  when she saw Mr. Friedmann’s number on 
call display.  Ms. MacDonald testified that she did not want to support him because, during their tenancy, Mr. Friedmann never di d anything helpful for her or Ms. Zemluk. 
Stephen Good 
[133]  At the time of the hearing, Mr. Good still  lived in the apartment building.  He 
gave evidence about seeing Mr. Friedmann w ithout a shirt on, negative comments that 
Mr. Friedmann made about Ms. MacGarvie,  and about Mr. Friedmann’s requests for 
reference letters.  
31 
2009 BCHRT 47 (CanLII)
[134]  Mr. Good testified that he had seen Mr. Fr iedmann outside without his shirt.  On 
one occasion, he saw him riding his bike in  the neighbourhood.  However, he couldn’t 
specifically recall seeing Mr. Friedmann doing yard work without a shirt on. 
[135]  Mr. Good also testified that Mr. Frie dmann complained to him about Ms. 
MacGarvie.  Mr. Friedmann said that he was very angry at her.  He talked a lot about Ms. 
MacGarvie being dishonest about where she was from, that is, not from Spain but 
Mexico, because when she first moved in, sh e said she was from Barcelona.  Also, Mr. 
Good testified that, as the h earing progressed, Mr. Friedma nn referred to Ms. MacGarvie 
in strong language, and called he r a “bitch”.  Mr. Good said it was hard for him to recall 
specific things that Mr. Friedmann said.  Hi s general tone was that the complainant was 
never going to amount to anything; she was sort of a gypsy and ha d all these men coming 
by. 
[136]  Mr. Good wrote a reference letter for Mr. Fr iedmann.   He did not want to write 
the letter, and wrote it because Mr. Friedma nn was really insistent about him doing so.  
The letter, dated April 2, 2005, states: 
In the time I have lived here, my dea lings with John Friedmann have been 
casual and friendly.  John has offered to replace the kitchen window in my 
apartment with a more efficient mode rn window, which we will arrange in 
the future.  Beyond that, he has not volunteered any repairs and none have 
been requested.  Regarding gifts, J ohn has offered me a fish tank, which I 
declined, and food, which I have accepted.  John has be en respectful of my 
privacy.  He has never requested to enter my apartment, and has only 
knocked at reasonable times.  John makes an effort to keep the building quiet.  Our relationship has been decent overall. 
[137]  Mr. Good was asked about other people in the apartment around the time that Mr. 
Friedmann was looking for lett ers of support.  He testifie d that there was a Japanese 
couple in the building, and Mr. Friedmann told  Mr. Good that he told the couple that 
friends do ‘favours’ for each other and if they were friends they woul d write the letter.  
Mr. Good said that Mr. Friedmann told him that  he also suggested to the couple that he 
would not give them the ‘favour’ of having a dog if they did not write the letter.  Those 
tenants moved out shortly after.     
32 
2009 BCHRT 47 (CanLII)
[138]  Mr. Good was asked if Mr. Friedmann discussed these proceedings with him.  Mr. 
Good replied that Mr. Friedmann had intende d to call him as a witness and discussed 
what he wanted him to say.  Mr. Friedmann sa id he wanted Mr. Good to testify that he 
trusted him 100%, and to say th ings that would make him s eem like a good landlord.  Mr. 
Friedmann told him that if Ms. MacGarvie’s lawyer ever tried to contact him he should 
hang up the phone.  Also, Mr. Friedmann told hi m that he wanted to take a gun and shoot 
everyone involved in th is case.  Mr. Good told Ms. MacG arvie’s counsel about this, and 
Ms. MacGarvie’s counsel contacted the police, who contacted him. 
[139]  Mr. Good testified that he was personally concerned about testifying because, at 
the time of the hearing, he st ill lived in the bu ilding.  It made Mr. Good uneasy because 
Mr. Friedmann had a key to his apartment.  He was concerned that Mr. Friedmann’s 
treatment of him was going to deteriorate, and in fact it already had.  Mr. Friedmann’s 
behaviour towards Mr. Good changed, and Mr . Good was concerned that Mr. Friedmann 
had increased his rent.    
Diana Thomson 
[140]  Ms. Thomson gave evidence regarding an incident where she was a guest of 
tenants in a downstairs suite in a house that Mr. Friedmann owned and resided in.  She 
testified that Mr. Friedmann hit her with a baseball bat and she sustained injuries as a 
result.  Mr. Friedmann was charged with a ssault, and was eventually acquitted.   
[141]  As noted above, Ms. MacGarvie testified th at she had heard about this incident 
from one of Mr. Friedmann’s neighbours, and knew that Mr. Friedmann had been 
charged with assault.  Ms. Thomson’s evidence  is of assistance in providing a context to 
Ms. MacGarvie’s fear of Mr. Friedmann and her resulting behaviour towards the end of 
her tenancy.  Ms. Thomson’s evidence is no t accepted as evidence of Mr. Friedmann’s 
character or propensity to behave in a certa in manner, including towards Ms. MacGarvie. 
Maria Matias 
[142]  Ms. Matias, who was still a tenant at the time of the hearing, was called as a 
witness by Mr. Friedmann and, to accommodate her schedule, she was allowed to testify 
in the middle of Ms. MacGarvie’s case.  She gave evidence about Mr. Friedmann doing 
33 
2009 BCHRT 47 (CanLII)
yard work without a shirt and about her di scussion with Ms. MacGarvie when her friend 
John visited.      
[143]  Mr. Friedmann asked Ms. Matias if she ever saw him around the apartment with 
no shirt.  She testified that sh e thought she might have seen him that way when he cut the 
grass, but he might have worn a singlet.   
[144]  Ms. Matias recalled that Ms. MacGarvie told her that sh e had to move out because 
Mr. Friedmann didn’t want her boyfriend.  Ms. Matias advised her to talk to Mr. 
Friedmann and offer to pay more money for the extra person, but Ms. MacGarvie moved 
out. 
III ANALYSIS AND DECISION 
[145]  Ms. MacGarvie filed her co mplaint under s. 10 of the Code , which provides: 
  (1) A person must not 
 (a) deny to a person or class of pers ons the right to occupy, as a tenant, 
space that is represented as being available for occupancy by a tenant, 
or 
 (b) discriminate against a person or class of persons regarding a term or 
condition of the tenancy of the space, 
because of the … sex … of that person …  
[146]  Ms. MacGarvie alleges both sexual harassment and discrimination on the basis of 
sex because she says that she was treated differently than male tenants.   
[147]  I conclude that Ms. MacGarvie has not me t her burden in demonstrating that she 
was discriminated against on the basis of sex.  There was scant evidence before me about 
Mr. MacGarvie’s treatment of male tenants.   I was not therefor e able to reach any 
conclusions about differential treatment of Ms. MacGarvie based on her sex.  However, I 
come to a different conclusion regarding some aspects of Ms. MacGarvie’s sexual 
harassment complaint.   
34 
2009 BCHRT 47 (CanLII)
[148]  As the Supreme Court of Canada explained in Janzen v. Platy Enterpirses Ltd.  
[1989] 1 S.C.R. 1252, an empl oyment case, sexual harassme nt may take a variety of 
forms: 
Sexual harassment is not limited to demands for sexual favours made 
under threats of adverse job consequen ces should the employee refuse to 
comply with the demands.  Victims of harassment need not demonstrate that they were not hired, were denied  a promotion or were dismissed from 
their employment as a result of thei r refusal to participate in sexual 
activity.  This form of harassment, in which the victim suffers concrete economic loss for failing to submit to sexual demands, is simply one manifestation of sexual harassment, al beit a particularly blatant and ugly 
one.  Sexual harassment also encompasse s situations in which the sexual 
demands are foisted upon unwilling em ployees or in which employees 
must ensure sexual groping, propositions, and inappropriate comments, but where no tangible economic rewards are attached to involvement in the behaviour. 
[149]  In Janzen , the court defined sexual harassment as follows: 
Without seeking to provide an exhaus tive definition of the term, I am of 
the view that sexual harassment in th e workplace may be broadly defined 
as unwelcome conduct of a sexual natu re that detrimentally affects the 
work environment or leads to advers e job-related consequences for the 
victims of the harassment.  It is , as Adjudicator Shime observed in Bell v. 
Ladas, supra, and as has been widely accep ted by other adjudicators and 
academic commentators, an abuse of  power.  When sexual harassment 
occurs in the workplace, it is an ab use of both economic and sexual power.  
Sexual harassment is a demeaning pract ice, one that cons titutes a profound 
affront to the dignity of the employees forced to endure it.  By requiring an employee to contend with unwelcome sexual actions or explicit sexual demands, sexual harassment in the wor kplace attacks the dignity and selfrespect of the victim both as an  employee and as a human being. 
[150]  In Dietrich v. Dhaliwal , 2003 BCHRT 6, the Tribunal concluded that the Supreme 
Court’s reasoning in  Janzen with respect to sexual harassment in the workplace is 
applicable to cases of sexual harassment in a tenancy.   
[151]  In order to establish sexual harassment, the complainant must establish that the 
respondent’s conduct was unsolicited and unwanted:  Mahmoodi v. University of British 
Columbia , [1999] B.C.H.R.T.D. No. 52 (Q.L.), paras. 140-141; Twohey v. Bartman et al , 
35 
2009 BCHRT 47 (CanLII)
2003 BCHRT 55, para. 202; and Algor v. Alcan and others (No. 2) , 2006 BCHRT 200, 
para. 177. 
[152]  In Mahmoodi , the Tribunal held that the test for establishing whether the alleged 
conduct is unwelcome is an objective one: 
…taking into account all the circum stances, would a reasonable person 
know that the conduct in question was not welcomed by the complainant?  
A complainant is not required to expressly object to the conduct unless the 
respondent would reasonably have no reason to suspect that it was 
unwelcome… 
…subtle indications of unwelcomeness may be sufficient to communicate 
that the conduct is unwelcome.  The f act that a complainant submits to or 
tolerates sexual demands does not nece ssarily mean they are welcome or 
solicited.  Behaviour may be  tolerated and yet unwelcome at the same time.  
The reasons for submitting to conduct may be closely related to the power differential between the parties and th e implied understandi ng that lack of 
co-operation could result in some fo rm of disadvantage (at paras. 140 and 
141). 
[153]  Ms. MacGarvie testified regarding seve ral different instances and types of 
behaviour that she alleged constitute sexual harassment or sexual discrimination.  I will 
consider each of these different incidents and types of behaviour  and whether, taken 
alone or together, they constitute sexual harassment.  While Ms. MacGarvie submitted that Mr. Friedmann’s behaviour towards other tenants also constituted sexual harassment, 
for the reasons discussed above, I have only considered Ms. MacGarvie’s allegations.  
1. Not wearing a shirt while working 
[154]  Ms. MacGarvie testified th at Mr. Friedmann was outsi de her living room window 
pruning a bush with no shirt on.  To her it seemed that every time Ms. MacGarvie looked 
over, he was looking at her, and that when she looked at him, he would look away and 
tense his entire body.  Mr. Good said he had seen Mr. Friedmann outside without his 
shirt, but he couldn’t recall seeing him doing yard work wit hout his shirt.  Ms. Matias 
also testified that she could not remember whether Mr. Friedmann cut the grass shirtless 
or in a singlet.   
36 
2009 BCHRT 47 (CanLII)
[155]  In the circumstances, it is difficult to come to any conclusions about this 
allegation.  Mr. Friedmann was the landlor d and did his own yard work, including 
pruning the bushes.  Based on the evidence befo re me, I conclude that there was nothing 
necessarily offensive about him working with hi s shirt off, and there was no evidence that 
he was using pruning bushes as a pretext for looking into Ms. MacGarvie’s window.  
Therefore, I cannot conclude that this one incident c onstitutes sexual harassment. 
2. Feeling that Mr. Friedmann had been  in Ms. MacGarvie’s apartment 
[156]  Ms. MacGarvie said that she was distur bed by Mr. Friedmann saying he saw her 
lying in her bedroom when she kept her blinds  closed, and by his testimony at the second 
hearing about the number of dinner plates she had and about her lying on her couch and 
watching movies.  Although I accept Ms. MacG arvie’s evidence on these points, I am 
unable to conclude that he had actually been in her apartment.  His comments may have 
been an attempt at intimidati on.  Overall, I am not satisfi ed that there is sufficient 
evidence to make a finding of sexual harassment.   
3. Residential Tenancy Act breaches 
[157]  The evidence is clear that Mr. Friedmann did not faithfully follow the 
requirements of the Residential Tenancy Act .  However, the evidence does not establish 
Mr. Friedmann’s failure to fo llow that legislation amounts to  sexual harassment or sexual 
discrimination against Ms. MacGarvie.   
4. Yelling and name calling  
[158]  Ms. MacGarvie testified that after he pus hed himself into her apartment to paint 
her bedroom, he told her she had mental pr oblems, that she was a “filthy animal” and a 
“fucking animal”.  He also called her these kinds of names when the police insisted he 
leave the apartment, and ranted to the police about what a horrible tenant she was.  Mr. Friedmann continued with this behaviour in the various pieces of correspondence set out 
above.   
[159]  I accept Ms. MacGarvie’s evidence on this point.  I have no difficulty finding that 
Mr. Friedmann was bullying and rude, and th at his conduct amounted to harassment.  
37 
2009 BCHRT 47 (CanLII)
Such behaviour is unacceptable, and may be  unlawful.  However, harassment is not 
contrary to the Code  unless it is related to a ground of  prohibited discrimination and Ms. 
MacGarvie testified that Mr. Friedmann’s bu llying and yelling extended to all tenants, 
both male and female.  In all of the circum stances, I am unable to conclude that Mr. 
Friedmann’s conduct was sufficiently related to Ms. MacGarvie’s sex so as to constitute 
sexual harassment or differential treatment based on sex under the Code .  However, as 
indicated later in this decision, the fact th at Mr. Friedmann was bullying and rude made 
the sexual harassment that did occur much more difficult fo r Ms. MacGarvie to endure. 
5. Aggressive behaviour  
[160]  Ms. MacGarvie testified about an occasion when Mr. Friedmann pushed his way 
into her apartment when he could have come back later.  However, I am not satisfied, 
based on the evidence, that this was sexual harassment.  However, this aggressive 
behaviour, when coupled with the sexual hara ssment, made the harassment all the more 
disturbing and this will be re flected in the remedy.   
6. Inappropriate comments, invitations and gifts   
[161]  Ms. MacGarvie testified a bout a number of inappropriate comments and gifts: 
• Giving her stained glass a nd saying it was so she could remember the sad 
boyfriends she left in Mexico;  
• Offering her bread on two occasions; 
• Bringing her flowers, which Ms. MacGar vie considered an intimate gift and 
which she testified made her uncomfortable; 
• Giving her a box of chocolates at Christma s, although she testified that he had 
several boxes and felt it wasn’t too personal; 
• Saying “Oh, look at these beautiful wo men, my tenants” and that he was 
looking for a wife but no one wanted to marry him; 
• An invitation to a soccer game coupl ed with a reference to sexy, 40’s, 
hardworking men, which Ms. MacGar vie felt referred to himself; 
• Asking if her boyfriend was in four tim es when coming to pick up the rent 
and repeating the question after she asked him to stop it; 
38 
2009 BCHRT 47 (CanLII)
• Coupling the gift of the mi rror with a comment that it was so she could see 
herself and looking over at he r bed as he said it; and 
• Installing a mirror in bathroom and sa ying that she needed extra mirrors 
because she was a beautiful woman and needed lots of mirrors. 
[162]  Ms. MacGarvie testified that  every time he came to her apartment, Mr. Friedmann 
would find an opportunity to make an ina ppropriate comment that made her feel 
uncomfortable.  He would look at her body and smile or look at the bedroom and ask if 
her boyfriend was in or would refer to her figure and ask if she was losing weight. 
[163]  Ms. MacGarvie testified that these comm ents were continuous and I accept that 
they permeated the landlord and tenant re lationship.  I also conclude that Mr. 
Friedmann’s gifts were used as a pretence to  go to Ms. MacGarvie’s apartment, where he 
then made inappropriate comments.  In my  view, Mr. Friedmann knew or ought to have 
known that this on-going commentary to a young  female tenant would be unwelcome and 
inappropriate, and that the gifts were al so unwelcome and inappropriate.  In the 
circumstances, I am therefore satisfied that this behaviour constituted sexual harassment.  
7. The Bicycle Incident 
[164]  Ms. MacGarvie testified that while s itting on a bike in the basement, Mr. 
Friedmann put his hand on her butto cks.  She described this as a very firm feel and not an 
accident.  I note that Mr. Friedma nn did not deny this in his res ponse.  I conclude that this 
incident clearly constitutes sexual harassment. 
8. Behaviour regarding boyfriends 
[165]  Ms. MacGarvie testified regarding Mr . Friedmann’s behaviour relating to 
boyfriends.  First there were unnecessary ques tions, such as asking if her boyfriend was 
in and asking if her male vi sitor was an old boyfriend or if she wished he was her 
boyfriend.  Mr. Friedman also made uncalled- for comments about her male friend being a 
bad man because he didn’t help her with pa inting, discussing Ms. MacGarvie’s sex life, 
saying he didn’t care who she slep t with but that her friend is a bad man and had to leave.  
This behaviour was particularly offensive because Ms. MacGarvie had told Mr. 
Friedmann that she would be having a visitor, and there was no evidence that this visitor 
39 
2009 BCHRT 47 (CanLII)
was disrupting the other tenants or otherw ise behaving inappropria tely. Mr. Friedmann 
consistently sexualized her relationship with her old friend and I find that Mr. 
Friedmann’s behaviour constitutes sexual harassment.  
9. Coming early in the morning, co ming unannounced, coming too often 
[166]  Ms. MacGarvie said that Mr. Friedmann did not provide an address.  He came to 
pick up rent every month in person but didn’t say when he  would come and didn’t say 
what would happen if no one was home.  She also testified that she thought he would 
come at times when he woul d catch her in her pyjamas. 
[167]  I have already concluded that Mr. Friedma nn used gifts as a pretence to go to Ms. 
MacGarvie’s apartment.  Although Mr. Friedmann’s timing in picking up the rent and 
otherwise calling on Ms. MacGarvie is suspicio us, I cannot conclude that his behaviour 
constituted sexual harassment.  I would requir e more evidence to make a conclusion on 
this point.  
Conclusion 
[168]  I conclude that Ms. MacG arvie has established that  Mr. Friedmann sexually 
harassed her.  I have consider ed all of the nine categories of allegations both separately 
and collectively and conclude that some constitute sexual harassment and some do not.     
[169]  I find that Ms. MacGarvie’s complaint against Mr. Friedmann regarding sexual 
harassment is justified. 
IV REMEDY 
[170]  Section 37(2) provides the Tribunal with th e authority to order a remedy if it finds 
a complaint is justified, and provides: 
  If the member or panel determines that the complaint is justified, the 
member or panel 
 (a) must order the person that contravened this Code to cease the 
contravention and to refrain from committing the same or a similar contravention, 
 (b) may make a declaratory order that the conduct co mplained of, or 
40 
2009 BCHRT 47 (CanLII)
similar conduct, is discrimina tion contrary to this Code, 
 (c) may order the person that contravened this Code to do one or 
both of the following: 
 (i) take steps, specified in the order, to ameliorate the effects 
of the discriminatory practice; 
 (ii) adopt and implement an employment equity program or 
other special program to ameliorate the conditions of 
disadvantaged individuals or groups if the evidence at the 
hearing indicates the person ha s engaged in a pattern or 
practice that contravenes this Code, and 
 (d) if the person discriminated agai nst is a party to the complaint, or 
is an identifiable member of a group or class on behalf of which 
a complaint is filed, may order th e person that contravened this 
Code to do one or more of the following: 
 (i) make available to the person discriminated against the 
right, opportunity or privilege that, in the opinion of the 
member or panel, the person was denied contrary to this 
Code; 
 (ii) compensate the person discriminated against for all, or a 
part the member or panel determines, of any wages or salary lost, or expenses in curred, by the contravention; 
 (iii) pay to the person discrimina ted against an amount that the 
member or panel considers appr opriate to compensate that 
person for injury to dignity, fee lings and self respect or to 
any of them. 
[171]  Ms. MacGarvie requested the following reme dies.  First, she sought a mandatory 
order that Mr. Friedmann cease the contrave ntion and refrain from committing the same 
or a similar contravention.  Ms. MacGarvie submitted that this can be accomplished by 
requiring the following: 
• Mr. Friedmann provide tenants with an address for delivery of their rent and 
notice as required under the Residential Tenancy Act ; 
• Except in emergencies, that Mr. Frie dmann provide tenants with written 
notice that he intends to enter their suite and the reasons for doing so; and 
• That Mr. Friedmann provide his young female tenants with a copy of the 
Residential Tenancy Act , “A Guide for Landlord and Tenants in British 
Columbia”, a publication available on the Residential Tenancy Branch’s 
website. 
41 
2009 BCHRT 47 (CanLII)
[172]  Ms. MacGarvie also sought co mpensatory orders pursuant to s. 37(2)(ii) for 
expenses in the amount of $3,164.59, which she submitted she incurred as a result of Mr. 
Friedmann’s breach of the Code : 
• $141.14: cost of additional cell phone minutes by Ms. MacGarvie for January 
and February 2005 for $98.24 and $42.90 respectively; 
• $35.31: cost of change of address; 
• $527.80: cost of camcorder and videotape for the purpose of documenting the harassment; 
• $203.89: moving costs; 
• $22.09: photocopying costs; 
• $12.00: fee paid to B.C. Assessment to obtain Mr. Friedmann’s address; 
• $2,182.36: hearing expenses (see attached Table); 
• $100: loss of shift while a ttending the hearing; and 
• $40: amount wrongfully deducted from damage deposit. 
[173]  Ms. MacGarvie sought “signifi cant” compensation for injury to dignity, feelings 
and self-respect.  In her written  submission, Ms. MacGarvie said: 
In this case, the harassment was verb al and physical.  It was aggressive 
and persisted during the currency of Ms. MacGarvie’s tenancy.  When Ms. 
MacGarvie made the decision to leave the Apartment Complex, she feared 
for her physical safety, even in her home which is the one place people 
should be able to seek protection.  Ms. MacGarvie was a single, young 
woman with few friends and no family  living locally.  She had no money 
to relocate and had to obtain a student loan for this purpose.  She was 
particularly vulnerable and Mr. Frie dmann exploited her vulnerability. 
The psychological impact of the harassment is apparent from Ms. MacGarvie’s actions at the time.  Sh e sought protection from her friends.  
She sought advice from the Resident ial Tenancy Office and the Vancouver 
Police Department.  Ms. MacGarvie did everything necessary to protect herself from Mr. Friedmann.  To this  day she is still concerned for her 
safety. 
[174]  Ms. MacGarvie also seeks both pre-judgme nt and post-judgment interest pursuant 
to the Court Order Interest Act, RSBC 1996, c. 79. 
42 
2009 BCHRT 47 (CanLII)
[175]  Although Mr. Friedmann did not remain fo r the continuation of  the hearing in 
March 2007, he was nevertheless given an opportunity to respond to Ms. MacGarvie’s 
closing submissions.  Mr. Friedmann replied, indicating that, due to health reasons, he 
was unable to respond to Ms. MacGarvie’s submission.  He also made a number of allegations against the Tribunal: 
I told Ms. McLean that I hold he r “responsible for my collapse and 
following ambulance treatment of July 26, 2006.” 
 
The reason is that Ms. McLean wa s running the hearing as “one way 
street”, totally i gnoring my comments. 
 
During 1st hearing, the student from Victor ia did not do anything for me.  
They just came to do learning and Madam Chair lost control of the 
hearing, and she was at one time yelling at  me.  She lost control of herself.  
It was not my fault that the 1st Hearing was not concluded. 
 
MacGarvie’s response from March 12th Hearing, for example, says she had 
a very important job interview in ki ndergarten and at 29 she still does not 
have a job, and she is living in a government shelter. 
 
Medical evidence about my health  is insufficient to support an 
adjournment. 
 
Obviously, my health a nd doctor’s letter means not hing to Ms. MacGarvie 
and is nothing when compared to her priorities. 
 
I maintain that my poor health is caused by the conduct of this Tribunal. 
 
Furthermore, the short deadline of April 3, 2007 for my Closing 
Submission is plain evidence of discrimination against me, because the Tribunal is not willing to understand th at I need time to regain my health 
and then properly respond. 
 
I am still asking for a new hearing w ith panel of 3 members, what I was 
asking before, because I don’t have trust in your office anymore.  (as written; cc’d to Attorney General) 
 
43 
2009 BCHRT 47 (CanLII)
1. Section 37(2)(a) Cease and Desist 
[176]  An order under s. 37(2)(a) is mandatory  when the complain t is found to be 
justified.  Therefore, I order Mr. Friedma nn to cease the contravention and refrain from 
committing the same or a similar contravention. 
2. Section 37(2)(c) Amelioration 
[177]  I accept Ms. MacGarvie’s evidence that Mr. Friedmann’s failure to provide an 
address for delivery, especially when she wished to serve him with her notice of 
terminaton of her tenancy, made it very difficult  for her.  Sections 13(1) and (2) of the 
Residential Tenancy Act , S.B.C. 2002, c. 78, require a landl ord to prepare and provide a 
written tenancy agreement that contains certain terms.  Subs ection 13(2)(e) requires that 
the tenancy agreement set out the address for service and the telephone number of the 
landlord or the landlord’s agent.  Clear ly, the tenancy agreement provided to Ms. 
MacGarvie did not include this information.   
[178]  As well, Ms. MacGarvie complained a bout Mr. Friedmann’s unannounced visits.  
This is contrary to s. 29 (1) and (2) of the Residential Tenancy Act , which provides: 
(1) A landlord must not enter a rental  unit that is subject to a tenancy 
agreement for any purpose unless one of the following applies: 
(a) the tenant gives permission at the time of the entry or not more 
than 30 days before the entry; 
(b) at least 24 hours and not more than 30 days before the entry, the 
landlord gives the tenant writt en notice that includes the 
following information: 
(i)  the purpose for entering, which must be reasonable; 
(ii)  the date and the time of th e entry, which must be between 8 
a.m. and 9 p.m. unless the tenant otherwise agrees; 
(c) the landlord provides housekeeping or related services under the 
terms of a written tenancy agreem ent and the entry is for that 
purpose and in accordance with those terms; 
44 
2009 BCHRT 47 (CanLII)
(d) the landlord has an order of th e director authorizing the entry; 
(e) the tenant has abandoned the rental unit; 
(f) an emergency exists and the entr y is necessary to protect life or 
property. 
(2) A landlord may inspect a rental unit monthly in accordance with 
subsection (1) (b). 
[179]  Although I agree that Mr. Friedmann should be ordered to follow the 
requirements of the Residential Tenancy Act , I did not find the evidence sufficient to 
conclude that Mr. Friedmann’s behaviour, with respect to th e terms and conditions of her 
tenancy, constituted sex discrimination.  Therefor e, the requested order is not appropriate 
in the circumstances.   
3. Section 37(2)(d)(ii), Expenses 
[180]  I have reviewed and accepted some of Ms. MacGarvie’s expenses, and have 
decided to award her a total of  $1,922.84.  Attached to this decision is a list of expenses 
that have been requested and awarded.  I am satisfied in the absen ce of any evidence or 
argument to the contrary from Mr. Friedmann that they are expenses incurred by Ms. 
MacGarvie.   
[181]  It is not appropriate to award Ms. MacGarvie 100% of the costs for the 
camcorder, given that she still has the use of it.  I have therefore awarded her $100 
towards that cost.  As well, I have not awarded Mr. Friedmann’s deduction from Ms. MacGarvie’s damage deposit.  This issue was a matter for the Residential Tenancy Branch.  Finally, I do not awar d the expenses specific to th e first hearing, that is, Ms. 
Thewlis’ travel expenses and other conduct mo ney.  As will be explained later in the 
costs application portion of th is decision, there is insufficient direct evidence before me 
to conclude that th e requirement to have a second he aring with a di fferent Tribunal 
Member was because of Mr. Friedmann’s conduct.  Therefore, I have not awarded expenses incurred in the first hearing.     
45 
2009 BCHRT 47 (CanLII)
4. Section 37(2)(d)(iii) Injury to Di gnity, Feelings and Self Respect 
[182]  In the past several years, awards for injury to dignity, feelings and self respect in 
sexual harassment cases have ranged from $1,200 ( Fougere v. Rallis and Kalamata 
Greek Taverna , 2003 BCHRT 23) to $15,000 ( Harrison v. Nixon Saf ety Consulting and 
others (No. 3) , 2008 BCHRT 463).  There has only been one award for sexual harassment 
in a tenancy situation, where $1,500 was awarded: Dietrick v. Dhaliwal , 2003 BCHRT 6.  
I also note that there has been an upwa rd trend in these awards over time.   
[183]  In Fougere, the Tribunal adopted the seven considerations to be taken into 
account when determining compensation for inju ry to dignity in sexual harassment cases 
that were set out in Torres v. Royalty Kitchenware Ltd . (1982), 3 C.H.R.R. D/858 (Ont. 
Bd. Inq.).  The Tribunal indicated that this list is not meant to  be exhaustive, that is, other 
factors could become important ov er time.  These factors are: 
1. the nature of the harassme nt, that is, was it simply  verbal or was it physical 
as well; 
2. the degree of aggressiveness and ph ysical contact in the harassment; 
3. the ongoing nature, that is, the ti me period of the harassment; 
4. its frequency; 
5. the age of the victim; 
6. the vulnerability of the victim; and 
7. the psychological impact of the harassment upon the victim. 
[184]  In this case, the harassment, except for one  occasion, was verbal.  However, it was 
inappropriate and continuous. While it never in cluded direct sexual invitations or explicit 
language, there were many comments about her appearance and referenc es to boyfriends.  
Ms. MacGarvie testified that, on occasion, she asked Mr. Friedmann to “stop it” and that 
she told him his remarks about her male visitor were unacceptable.  The harassment continued over the course of Ms. MacGar vie’s tenancy, which was approximately one 
year.  Ms. MacGarvie was a young  woman, and was a student of limited financial means.  
Mr. Friedmann had power over her, because nice apartments, at a reasonable price, and in 
a good location were at a premium.   
46 
2009 BCHRT 47 (CanLII)
[185]  Due to Mr. Friedmann’s abrasive, argumen tative and aggressive behaviour, the 
sexual harassment took on a differe nt character and Ms. MacGarvi e started to be afraid of 
Mr. Friedmann.  This intensified when she heard about the baseball bat episode.  Ms. 
MacGarvie was in a situation where she felt sh e had to move because of Mr. Friedmann’s 
harassment, but then was fearful of the dealin gs she had to have with him in order to 
move, that is, giving notice and allowing him to  show the apartment.  For example, she 
went to a great deal of trouble to ensure th at he could not come to her apartment when 
she was alone.  Ms. MacGarvie’s fears were justified in that there was a day when he 
pushed himself in when she was alone and th e police had to be ca lled.  Ms. MacGarvie 
testified that, as of the date of the hear ing, she remained afraid for her safety.   
[186]  After considering all of these factors,  I conclude that an award of $10,000 is 
appropriate. 
5. Interest 
[187]  Ms. MacGarvie is entitled to interest on th e compensation that has been ordered.  I 
order pre-judgment intere st in accordance with the Court Order Interest Act , R.S.B.C. 
1996, c. 79, as amended, for her expenses from  March 16, 2007.  Post-judgment interest 
is ordered on compensation for expenses and for injury to dignit y, feelings and selfrespect. 
V APPLICATION FOR COSTS 
1. Ms. MacGarvie’s Submissions 
[188]  Ms. MacGarvie seeks costs against Mr. Fr iedmann pursuant to s. 37(4) of the 
Code, which provides: 
  The member or panel may award costs 
 (a) against a party to a complaint who has engaged in improper conduct 
during the course of the complaint, and 
 (b) without limiting paragraph (a), against a party who contravenes a rule 
under section 27.3 (2) or an or der under section 27.3 (3). 
47 
2009 BCHRT 47 (CanLII)
[189]  Ms. MacGarvie submits that Mr. Friedmann engaged in improper conduct during 
the course of the proceedings and has provided substantial details of this alleged 
improper conduct in her submissions.  Ms. MacGarvie summarized her position as follows: 
The Complainant submits that it can be  expected that counterparties to a 
human rights complaint may be upset, hurt or angry.  Nevertheless, this 
Tribunal in Stopps v. Just Ladies Fitness, supra , [2007 BCHRT 125] 
clearly stated there are limits to ho w they can express their upset or 
outrage.  Writing public letters cont aining exaggerated and defamatory 
accusations against the counterparty ought not to be sanctioned by this 
Tribunal.  Respondents in a positi on of power, such as employer and 
landlords, should be expected to be  reasonably careful in securing 
witnesses who may feel intimidated or coerced into testifying on their 
behalf.  In this case,  Mr. Friedmann’s conduct in trying to compel 
witnesses on his behalf [went] far beyond that which is acceptable in a 
legal proceeding.  His threats in some cases went so  far as to constitute 
witness tampering.  Mr. Friedmann had a perfectly fair and acceptable 
forum to defend his name, and … to pres ent his case to the Tribunal.  This 
is the one thing that he did not do.  Instead, he chose to make hostile and defamatory letters about the Complainant, her witnesses, and the Tribunal.  Accordingly, a substantial award of  costs against Mr. Friedmann is 
justified pursuant o s. 37(4) of the Code .  The Complainant submits that 
this award should be comparable to  that awarded by the Tribunal in 
Fougere v. Rallis and Kalamata Greek Taverna (No. 3) , 2003 BCHRT 56. 
2. Analysis and Decision/Costs Application  
[190]  In McLean v. B.C. (Ministry of Public  Safety and Solicitor General – Liquor 
Distribution Branch) , 2006 BCHRT 103, the Tribunal reviewed  the case law in this area 
and the Tribunal’s approach to costs applications:   
… there has been a cautious and gradua l expansion of the circumstances in 
which the Tribunal has been prepared to find a party to have engaged in 
improper conduct, and thereby be exposed to the possibility of an award of costs:  see, for example, Bains v. Metro College Inc. and others (No. 2) , 
2004 BCHRT 7; Altakla v.  Power and another (No. 3) , 2004 BCHRT 253; 
Jiwany  and Jiwany  v. West Vancouver Municipal Transit , 2005 BCHRT 
172; Mahal  v. Hartley (No. 2) , 2004 BCHRT 63; Jacobs v. Dynamic 
Equipment Rentals Ltd. and Stewart (No. 2) , 2005 BCHRT 353; and 
Matthews  v. Huckleberry Mines and others (No. 2) , 2006 BCHRT 93.  In 
my view, the Tribunal’s increased w illingness to consider conduct to be 
improper, and thereby open a party to an award of costs, is largely related 
48 
2009 BCHRT 47 (CanLII)
to characteristics of the direct ac cess system.  Many parties before the 
Tribunal now engage in a significant amount of pre-heari ng litigation.  The 
manner in which that litigation is c onducted can have a si gnificant effect 
on the processing and eventual hear ing of complaints, and can exact 
significant costs, financial and otherw ise, on both othe r parties and the 
Tribunal.  Under the Code , the Tribunal has very limited tools at its 
disposal in order to control parties’ conduct; findings of improper conduct, 
and the resulting possibility of cost s, are the main tool available. 
In my view, the expansion of the ci rcumstances in which the Tribunal is 
prepared to find conduc t to be improper, and thereby subject to the 
potential of an order for costs, is ap propriate.  I agree with the comment of 
the Tribunal in Ghinis  that the standard set in Hendrickson  may be too 
high in some cases.  For example, where a party contravenes a rule or an order, such conduct may, under the express terms of s. 37(4)(b), constitute improper conduct.  While a party’s inte ntion in doing so may be relevant, 
no specific intention is necessary for th e breach of a rule or order to be 
improper.  More generally, while conduct which is the result of intentional 
wrongdoing may certainly be “improper”, in my view, improper conduct is not necessarily limited to intentional wrongdoing.  Any conduct which has a significant impact on the integrity of the Tribunal’s processes, including conduct which has a significant prejudicial impact on another party, may constitute improper conduct within the meaning of s.  37(4).  (paras. 7 and 
8) 
[191]  Since that time, the Tribunal has found improper conduct in a broad range of 
circumstances.  The categories wh ich apply in this case include: 
• Failure to abide by the Tribunal’s orders or directions;  
• Failure to provide disclosure in a timel y manner or failure to otherwise abide 
by the Tribunal’s time lines; 
• Showing disrespect for the Tribunal, its members and/or staff, or its 
proceedings;  
• Attacking another party, their counsel, or  a third party, or otherwise engaging 
in inappropriate communications;  
• Conduct resulting in a serious impact on the integrity of the Tribunal’s processes; and 
• Engaging in intimidating, coercive  and retaliatory conduct.    
[192]  The allegations of improper conduct in re gard to Mr. Friedmann can be divided 
into roughly four categories:  hearing conduct, correspon dence with the Tribunal, 
49 
2009 BCHRT 47 (CanLII)
intimidating behaviour, and failure to abide by the Tribunal’s orders and directions.  I 
will discuss the allegations unde r each of these subheadings. 
A. Hearing Conduct 
First Hearing 
[193]  Ms. MacGarvie testified that  Mr. Friedmann delayed the first hearing by claiming 
that he did not receive documents, and then lie d about the fact that he had signed for the 
documents.  Further, although the complaint ha d been filed in early  2005 and after an 
adjournment and pre-hearing conferences wh ere special needs could be discussed, Mr. 
Friedmann caused further delays in the first hearing by arriving at the continuation of the 
hearing on April 7, 2006 and requesting an interpreter.  As well, Ms. MacGarvie testified 
that Mr. Friedmann objected to all of her witnesses and strongly objected to Ms. Thompson remaining in the hearing room after she had finished her testimony.   
[194]  In regard to the delay caus ed on the first day of the hearing when Mr. Friedmann 
denied receiving documents, I find that this amounts to be improper conduct.  I also find 
that Mr. Friedmann’s objections to Ms. Thom pson remaining in the hearing room to be 
improper conduct.  The Tribunal’s hearings are public and any person may observe the 
proceedings.  Witnesses are excluded until they give their evidence and then they may stay for the rest of the proceedings.  For Mr. Friedmann to strongly object to this, in the 
absence of any evidence that Ms. Thompson was disrupting the proceedings, is improper 
conduct.   
[195]  However, I do not have enough informati on to conclude that Mr. Friedmann’s 
objections to Ms. MacGarvie’s witnesses cons tituted improper conduct.  There can be a 
number of valid reasons for objecting to a witness, for exampl e, that the witness was not 
on the witness list provided to th e party or that the evidence of  the witness is irrelevant.  
Without knowing the context, I cannot c onclude that Mr. Friedmann’s conduct was 
improper on that basis.   
[196]  In regard to the delay required to obtain an interpreter, I agree that this request 
should have been made much earlier.  Suspicious though the timing may be, I cannot 
50 
2009 BCHRT 47 (CanLII)
conclude that this request was a delay tactic and thus improper.  I must also consider the 
possibility that as the hearing proceeded, Mr. Friedmann or his representative realized 
that he was unable to properl y understand the witnesses or the proceedings without an 
interpreter. 
Second Hearing 
[197]  First, Ms. MacGarvie alleged that Mr . Friedmann caused needless delays and 
interruptions by refusing to take directions from the Tr ibunal.  I agree with Ms. 
MacGarvie in regard to this allegation.  While Ms. MacGarvie’s counsel was examining 
her witnesses, Mr. Friedmann interrupted almo st continually.  I explained to him many 
times through his interpreter that he would have an opportunity to cross-examine the 
witnesses and that he would then  have an opportunity to tell his version of events and call 
his own witnesses.  However, Mr. Friedmann continued to interrupt, most often in a loud and angry fashion.  His constant interruptions  affected Ms. MacGarvi e’s right to a fair 
hearing, and his behaviour undul y lengthened the hearing and added to the stress of the 
parties involved.  It was improper conduct. 
[198]  Ms. MacGarvie also submitted that Mr. Friedmann caused unnecessary delay in 
the second hearing by appearing at its c ontinuation on March 12, 2007 and requesting an 
adjournment for medical reasons without pr oper documentation.  She says that this 
occurred even though the case ma nager invited the parties to raise any preliminary issues 
with the Tribunal in advance of the hearing.   
[199]  In MacGarvie v. Friedmann (No. 3) , 2007 BCHRT 133, I outlined the Tribunal’s 
communications with Mr. Friedmann where he  was told the nature of the medical 
information required in order to successfully apply for an adjournment.  As well, he was 
informed that applications should be brought in a timely ma nner.  Mr. Friedmann did not 
follow these instructions, and instead faxed a very minimal medical note indicating he 
would be unable to take part in the hearing.  Given that th e hearing had to be adjourned 
several times, including the fact that a second hearing had to be conducted after the first 
hearing was nearly concluded, much more was required from Mr. Friedmann.  In these 
51 
2009 BCHRT 47 (CanLII)
circumstances, his failure to provide suffici ent medical information and to make a timely 
application to adjourn constitute improper conduct.   
[200]  Ms. MacGarvie also complained that Mr. Friedmann requested an adjournment to 
obtain legal counsel, even though he had ample time to have arranged for representation 
between the start of th e second hearing and its continuation in March 2007.  She said Mr. 
Friedmann had representation in this compla int previously and could reasonably be 
expected to know how to go about  retaining legal counsel in a timely way.  I agree.  To 
argue that an adjournment to retain legal c ounsel was reasonable, at that stage of the 
proceedings, was not reasonable and also was improper conduct. 
[201]  As well, at the hearing, it was reported to me that Mr. Friedmann had called Ms. 
MacGarvie “fucking garbage”.  I instruct ed Mr. Friedmann not to address Ms. 
MacGarvie unless she was on the witness stand.  Also, at some point in Ms. MacGarvie’s 
testimony, Mr. Friedmann interrupted the hear ing to call Ms. MacGarvie “a very sick 
woman.”  I told him there were to be no mo re outbursts.  This behaviour constitutes 
improper conduct.  
B. Correspondence with the Tribunal  
[202]  Ms. MacGarvie says that Mr. Friedma nn made unfounded accusations or smears 
against Ms. MacGarvie, her witnesses and the Tribunal in his response to the complaint, 
and in letters to the Tribunal and the Co mmunity Legal Assistan ce Society, some of 
which were copied to the Atto rney General.  I have revi ewed Mr. Friedmann’s Response 
and letters and find that they are full of smears and invectiv e, in particular against Ms. 
MacGarvie.  In summary, Mr. Friedm ann stated that Ms. MacGarvie was: 
• A bad tenant; 
• A liar; 
• Mexican rather than Spanish (a lthough Ms. MacGarvie was born in 
Canada); 
• Mentally ill, including request ing that the Tribunal order a 
psychological evaluation; 
52 
2009 BCHRT 47 (CanLII)
• Unable to take care of herself; 
• Intentionally causing problems; and  
• A danger and a menace to society. 
Mr. Friedmann also stated that he is “not the first victim”, and that Ms. MacGarvie: 
• Will never be a good citizen and should be deported; 
• Deals only with the RCMP, Mexican po lice, lawyers, welfare officials, 
and Vancouver East Side Women’s Centre; 
• Travels across the country seeking adventure, welfare, and a free 
education; and 
• Does not have a job and is liv ing in a government shelter. 
[203]  Mr. Friedmann also made allegations agai nst members of the Tribunal, as follows: 
• He had concerns about the Tribunal Chair because of past experience, 
saying “They hate my name”; 
• The Tribunal Member who conducted th e first hearing lost control of 
herself and yelled at him; 
• That Tribunal Member who conducted the first hearing lied about him; 
• That Tribunal Member who conducte d the first hearing admitted Ms. 
MacGarvie’s witnesses but not Mr. Friedmann’s (to which Ms. 
MacGarvie responded that what Mr. Friedmann wanted admitted were not witnesses but letters, which we re accepted for a limited purpose); 
• That he held me responsible for his collapse on July 26, 2006, because I 
was running the hearing as a “one way street” and totally ignoring his 
comments; and  
• That his poor health is caus ed by the Tribunal’s conduct. 
[204]  In Bakhtiyari v. BCIT (No. 6) , 2007 BCHRT 320, the Tribunal said: 
Since September 2006, Ms. Bakhtiyari has made negative references about 
Tribunal staff, BCIT personnel and BCIT’s legal counsel.  In my view, this 
type of conduct cannot be condoned by the Tribunal.  Ms. Bakhtiyari also accused the Tribunal staff of  lying, taking bribes and being prostitutes.  As 
the Tribunal stated in Stone , no participant before this Tribunal, nor their 
counsel, should be subjected to this kind of scurrilous attack on their 
53 
2009 BCHRT 47 (CanLII)
character.  As in Stone , Ms. Bakhtiyari does not defend her conduct and, in 
my view, no defence is possible.  Further, although many of Ms. 
Bakhtiyari’s negative references were  directed at Tri bunal staff and its 
processes, BCIT was required to addr ess these issues thereby increasing 
the delay and costs to it.   
After my decision in Bakhtiyari (No. 5) , Ms. Bakhtiyari continued to make 
unfounded and very serious allegations in emails and letters.  These were 
sent to various media outlets, pol iticians and BCIT personnel who had 
nothing to do with this complaint.  These communications continued to 
have an adverse effect on the processing of this complaint and those involved in this process.  In this re spect, they fall with in the meaning of 
improper conduct.   
[205]  Mr. Friedmann, throughout the entire peri od that the complaint has been before 
the Tribunal, has made slanderous remarks against Ms. MacGarvie based on no evidence.  
No party to a complaint should have to  tolerate this kind of behaviour.   
[206]  Therefore, I conclude that Mr. Friedma nn’s remarks in his response and various 
letters to the Tribunal about Ms. MacGar vie and the Tribunal constitute improper 
conduct. 
C. Intimidating Behaviour Outside of the Hearing 
[207]  Ms. MacGarvie made a number of accusati ons about Mr. Friedmann’s behaviour 
outside of the hearing room.  First, she alle ged that, after she filed her complaint, Mr. 
Friedmann defamed her to othe r tenants in his building, wh ich she said was damaging to 
her reputation.  I have set out the evidence in this regard above.   
[208]  Second, Mr. Friedmann coerced his tenants into providing him with letters of 
support.  As discussed above, Ms. Brazier test ified that she wrote a letter of support for 
Mr. Friedmann because she was worried about not getting her damage deposit back.  Ms. 
Zemluk also said she was concerned that if she didn’t write a lett er in support of Mr. 
Friedmann, it might jeopardize her tenancy.  She also testified that Mr. Friedmann 
offered to pay her father in exchange for his support.  Mr. Good said that he did not want 
to write a letter of support, but he did it be cause Mr. Friedmann was really insistent.  
54 
2009 BCHRT 47 (CanLII)
Finally, Ms. MacDonald said th at Mr. Friedmann called her a “fucking bitch” because 
she would not support him.   
[209]  As well, during a conversation with Mr . Good, Mr. Friedma nn made a serious 
threat of violence against witnesses and part icipants in these proceedings.  At a time 
when he knew that Mr. Good might be a witn ess for Ms. MacGarvie, Mr. Friedmann said 
he wanted to take a gun and shoot everyone involved in this case.   This threat was 
reported to the police.   
[210]  There is no reason for me to disbe lieve Mr. Good’s test imony regarding Mr. 
Friedmann’s threats.  Mr. Friedmann knew or ought to have known that these comments 
would have a chilling effect on Mr. Good (a potentia l witness) and that  they could make 
their way back to Ms. MacGarvie and other participants in th e hearing.  In my view, Mr. 
Friedmann’s behaviour was ve ry serious misconduct.   
[211]  Finally, Ms. MacGarvie alleged that the necessity for a new hearing was caused 
by Mr. Friedmann’s impr oper conduct.  In MacGarvie v. Friedmann (No. 2) , 2006 
BCHRT 330, I wrote the following: 
Ms. MacGarvie referred to instan ces of improper conduct during the 
hearing.  However, her claim for costs is mainly focused on the necessity 
for a new hearing, due to Mr. Friedmann’s improper conduct.  Mr. Friedmann denies the improper conduc t.  After reviewing all of the 
materials filed by both parties with re spect to this application, I am not 
persuaded that I have sufficient, reliable information that Mr. Friedmann engaged in improper behaviour which re sulted in a new hearing having to 
be scheduled.   
In all the circumstances of this case, I am of the view that the matter of 
costs should be deferred to the end of the hearing.  This will give Ms. MacGarvie an opportunity to explore Mr. Friedmann’s behaviour in the 
course of the previous hearing, in particular during Mr. Friedmann’s cross-examination.  That being said, the allegations made by Ms. MacGarvie 
regarding Mr. Friedmann’s conduct dur ing the hearing process are, if 
proved, the kinds of misbehaviour that would attract a substantial order of 
costs.  Therefore, Ms. MacGarvie’s application for costs is deferred.  
(paras. 12 and 13) 
[212]  At the second hearing, Ms. MacGarvie tes tified about the events that she said 
necessitated a second hearing.  However, her evidence was not  direct evidence of what 
55 
2009 BCHRT 47 (CanLII)
had transpired: the Member pr esiding over the first hearing told the Registrar what had 
happened, the Registrar told the parties’ couns el at a pre-hearing conference what the 
Member had told her, and Ms. MacGarvie’s counsel then told Ms.  MacGarvie.  Ms. 
MacGarvie’s counsel did not testify, and Ms. MacGarvie’s evidence about what her 
counsel told her is hearsay.  I know how ever that a new hearing was necessary. 
[213]   The only other information before me regarding why the Member presiding over 
the first hearing recused hers elf are statements about what  transpired set out in Ms. 
MacGarvie’s submissions on her costs application.  Information contained in submissions 
is not evidence, and I cannot rely on it.  As well, although Ms. MacG arvie’s counsel said 
that the police were contacted regarding these events, no police reports were submitted into evidence.  
[214]  Therefore, I continue not to have sufficient, reliable information that Mr. 
Friedmann engaged in improper behaviour whic h resulted in a new hearing having to be 
scheduled.   
D. Failure to Abide by the Tribunal’s Orders and Directions 
[215]  Ms. MacGarvie submitted that Mr. Friedmann did not comply with an order for 
disclosure made at a pre-he aring conference on July 13, 2 006.  As I understand it, the 
disclosure that Mr. Friedmann failed to make was the following:  
• After Mr. Friedmann said that he had taken part in hearings at the 
Residential Tenancy Branch, Mr. Friedmann was ordered to produce copies of all Residential Tenancy Bran ch decisions within the last five 
years; and  
• Contact information for persons who rented out Ms. MacGarvie’s 
apartment after her, as well as contact information for his witnesses. 
[216]  The failure to abide by th e Tribunal’s orders for disc losure, without reasonable 
excuse, also constitutes improper conduct.   
56 
2009 BCHRT 47 (CanLII)
E. Quantum 
[217]  I have found that Mr. Friedmann engaged in  improper conduct in many respects.   
In Kelly v. ICBC , 2007 BCHRT 382, the Tribunal stated: 
Unlike other monetary awards by the Tribunal, the primary purpose of an 
award of costs is punitive, not compensa tory. In addition, such an award is 
meant to act as a deterrent to prevent future participants from committing 
similar acts.  In Bains v.  Metro College Inc. and others (No. 2) , 2004 
BCHRT 7, the Tribunal stated that an award of costs “shou ld be sufficient 
to signal the Tribunal’s condemnation of the complainant’s conduct and to 
serve the punitive purpose of such an award”. (at para. 18)   
Flowing from this, the primary factor  taken into account by the Tribunal in 
determining the quantum of a cost awar d has been the nature and severity 
of the behaviour which is being sa nctioned, and the impact of that 
behaviour on the integrity of the Tri bunal’s processes.  In addition, and in 
appropriate circumstances, the Tri bunal has taken into account other 
factors, including the following:  
• the ability of the party against wh om costs are awarded to pay any 
award: Mahal v. Hartley , 2004 BCHRT 63; 
• the relative culpability of the party with respect to the behaviour in 
question: Neuls  v. Ann Davis Transition Society and Jacob (No. 2) , 
2007 BCHRT 5;  
• any factors, such as a disability, which may have contributed to the 
behaviour in question: Stopps , Bakhtiyari; and 
• any other consequences to the party which have arisen as a result of 
the sanctioned behaviour: Bakhtiyari; Glumac v. Fusco and others 
(No. 4) , 2006 BCHRT 578 (paras. 90 and 91) 
[218]  After considering these fact ors, I believe that a subs tantial award of costs is 
appropriate.  Mr. Friedmann threatened the participants in this  hearing, and made 
unfounded allegations about virtually every party involved, including the Tribunal.  He 
delayed the conduct of this case by his behaviour in the hearing and by his failure to 
follow the Tribunal’s orders and directions .  He made life very difficult for Ms. 
MacGarvie, in particular, and sh e testified that as of the date of the hearing, she continued 
to be fearful.  As well, his behaviour has seriously impacted the Tribunal’s processes.  
57 
2009 BCHRT 47 (CanLII)
Ms. MacGarvie provided evidence that Mr. Friedmann owns several properties in 
Vancouver and therefore has the means to pay a s ubstantial award of costs.  In all of these 
circumstances, I have decided that an order for costs of $7,500 is appropri ate in this case.   
[219]  Ms. MacGarvie is entitled to post-judgment interest on these costs in accordance 
with the Court Order Interest Act , R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 79, as amended. 
VI CONCLUSION 
[220]  In conclusion, I have found the complain t to be justified and make the following 
orders: 
(a) Pursuant to s. 37(2)(a) of the Code , Mr. Friedmann is to cease 
and desist the contravention of s. 13 of the Code ; 
(b) Pursuant to s. 37( 2)(d)(ii), Mr. Friedmann is to pay Ms. 
MacGarvie $1,922.84 for her expenses;  
(c) Pursuant to s. 37(2)(d)(iii), Mr. Friedmann is to pay Ms. MacGarvie $10,000 in respect  of injury to he r dignity, feelings 
and self respect; 
(d) Pursuant to s. 37(4), Mr. Frie dmann is to pay Ms. MacGarvie 
$7,500 as costs for his improper conduct; and 
(e) Pursuant to the Court Order Interest Act , pay Ms. MacGarvie 
pre-judgment and post-judgement interest on the amount ordered for expenses in (b), and post- judgment interest on the amounts 
ordered in (c) and (d).
